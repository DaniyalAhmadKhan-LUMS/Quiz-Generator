       " Document(page_content='4 \\n \\n1. Introduction  \\nThe concepts of sustainability and impact encompass a wide variety of dimensions and perspectives. There \\nexist multiple definitions of sustainability and impact, and these have generated an extensive debate among \\nacademics and communities of practitioners.  As outlined during this course, impact can be considered as the \\nchange caused by an organization or an intervention in a social, environmental or economic outcome. Lately, \\nthe management and measurement of impact has become a mantra for those willing to c reate a positive \\nchange at a societal and/or environmental level. This is because claims about making a difference are no longer \\nenough, and evidence is required concerning the change that any agents in society has been created (Ebrahim, \\n2013). To produce this evidence, it is necessary to develop appropriate approaches and methodologies to \\nmanage and measure the generated impact.  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement is a topical and complex theme. It is of interest to a \\nvariety of actors, s uch as entrepreneurs, managers of social enterprise, non -profit organizations, lenders, \\ninvestors, managers of for -profit organizations, policy makers and academics. At this time of significant \\nchange, the debate on this theme appears particularly relevant , and the need to include the practice of \\nmonitoring and measuring impact in the organizations’ strategy is gaining momentum. This is particularly related to the attempt of public administrations to reengineer their procurement schemes according to: (a) \\nan evolving outcome- based paradigm; (b) diffusion of evidence -based practices in philanthropy as well as in \\npublic policies; (c) the interest of financial actors in measuring the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) \\ncriteria.  \\nThese elements increase the urgency for organizations to manage, quantify and make explicit their generated \\nvalue. In this context, sustainability and impact management and measurement have become strategic, since \\nthey can allow an organization to communicate its results both externa lly and internally. In the first case (i.e., \\nexternally), sustainability and impact management and measurement can contribute to organizations’ \\nstrategic positioning and/or reputation. In the second case (i.e. internally), managing and measuring sustainabi lity and impact can allow organizations to: (a) improve impact generation processes; (b) build their \\nown identity as a transformative actors able to solve societal challenges; (c) improve performances, on the \\nbasis of impact goals and targets; (d) integrate measurement approaches of investment funds and investees’ operations.  \\n2. The conc ept of (social) impact  \\nWhile social impact might be considered as a key performance -based dependent variable related to hybrid \\norganizations, the definition and conceptualization of social impact is still debated. With regard to the \\nterminology, social impact is frequently used in the existing literature as a synonymous of social value (Moss, \\nShort, Payne, & Lumpkin, 2011; Santos, 2012), social performance (Husted  & Salazar, 2006; Mair & Marti, \\n2006; Nicholls, 2008), social returns (Emerson, 2003), and social accounting (Nicholls, 2009). Despite \\nsimilarities and affinities, these terms actually refer to different concepts. Moreover, the fact that the concept of soc ial impact can be applied to various domain, such as education, health care, environmental sustainability, \\nand poverty, make its conceptualization even harder (Izzo, 2013).  \\n2.1 Social value and impact  \\nThe concept of social value  creation has been variously  defined and characterized by many authors. Schwartz \\n(1990) argued that an entrepreneurial activity creates social value when the aggregate utility of society’s \\nmembers increases after accounting for the opportunity cost of all the resources consumed during the activity.  ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5. Sustainability and impact management and measurement.pdf', 'page': 3}, lookup_index=0),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5 \\n \\nDees (1998), focusing particularly on social entrepreneurial forms, underlined that, broadly speaking, the \\ncreation of social value implies the creation of long -lasting improvements in society. This is particularly \\nimportant for those entre preneurial forms whose primary mission is the creation of social value, namely \\ndifferent forms of social entrepreneurship and social purpose organizations.  \\nMany authors stressed that social value creation is strictly related to the capacity of entrepreneur ial activity \\nof generating value for a large variety of stakeholders. Brickson (2007) stresses that the social value can be \\nproduced by organisations in different ways based on their relationships with internal and external \\nstakeholders. She explains that value can be created for consumers and employees by meeting human needs \\n(personal esteem, belongingness, and love) and fostering human virtues (bravery, caring, and justice), linking the generation of social value to ethical values in entrepreneurial activ ity. According to Kroeger and Weber \\n(2014) the social value generated by an organization is deeply tied to the capacity of generating and improving  \\nthe well -being of a broad and various categories of stakeholders.  Finally, Lazzarini (2020) provides a nove l \\ndefinition of social value as the sum “broad social benefits to a given population (including more vulnerable \\ngroups) minus their associated provision costs” (p.19). In this sense, social value creation, can be pursued both \\nby private and public organiza tions, and it is strictly related to the capacity of entrepreneurial activity of \\ngenerating value for a large variety of stakeholders and limiting to shareholders.  From this perspective, \\nenterprises and private organizations can create social value by impr oving the well -being of individuals, \\ncommunities and society in general and sharing the value they produce with diverse types of actors (Porter \\nand Kramer, 2019).  \\nSocial value is a broad, systemic and network -based concept that relates to the societal and environmental \\nbenefits generated by an organization or an initiative.  On the contrary, when we shift to the concept of impact, \\nwe introduce a dynamic idea of change and causality and we refer to those changes which are strictly related \\nto the effect of the  organisation’s activities.  These changes can be measured and evaluated through specific \\nmethodologies.  If social value describes the wider social, economic, and environmental benefits that derive \\nfrom an organisation’s work, the impact refers to the speci fic changes taking place as a result of our activities \\nor services.   \\nTo understand the concept of impact, it may be useful to refer to the analogous concept used in natural \\nsciences. In physics the word impact is the spatial -temporal momentum in which a mo ving object clashes with \\nanother. The collision leads to the generation of both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects are detectable \\nand can be related to the two colliding objects. On the contrary, indirect effects can be undetected and are \\nrelated to the broader environment and ecosystem where the objects are placed. Similarly, in social sciences \\nthe word “impact” refers to the long -term effects generated by different types of interventions. The majority \\nof scholars and practitioners tends to clearl y distinguish between the concept of impact and those of output \\nand outcome. Particularly, impact usually concern a long -term perspective and a broad focus on macro \\ncontexts as a unit of analysis.  \\nTo understand the difference between impact, outcomes and outputs it is possible to exploit the so -called \\nimpact value chain ( Bengo et al., 2016) . The impact value chain is a theory -based framework that illustrates \\nhow an organisation’s activities lead to its ultimate desired outcome and impact. The Impact Value Chain is a \\nlinear and theory -based instrument: it is based on a pre -existing theory of Change which is articulated and \\nlinearized by the framework distinguishing the ventures activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact (see Clark \\net al., 2004).  \\nThe chain al lows to visualise the movement from outputs to impact.  Outputs include those products and \\nservices directly generated by an organization activity thanks to the transformation of inputs. Outputs are used \\nby the target group of beneficiaries, customers, or u sers. Outcomes are the changes experienced by the target \\nbeneficiaries in the short term, thanks to the use of the outputs. Finally, impacts are the changes generated ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5. Sustainability and impact management and measurement.pdf', 'page': 4}, lookup_index=0),\n",

This set of definitions \\nmainly draws on Social Sciences disciplines such as Economics and Econometrics and variously relies on the \\nmethodological process leading to the identification and concept of “impact”.  \\n  \\n• By impact we mean the portion of the total outcome that happened as a result of the activity of the \\nventure, above and beyond what would have happened anyway.

(Grieco et al., 2015)  \\n \\nThese definitions can be grouped under the broad definition:  \\n \\nImpacts are those outcomes (of interventions, policies, programs) adjusted for what would have happened \\nanyway, actions of others and unintended consequences.  \\n \\nThe concept of impact, if regard ed under this set of definitions, appears quite broad and open to a variety of \\ninterpretations. From this perspective, the concept of impact can refer to economic, social and environmental dimensions.  The integration between these three categories appears  coherent with the triple bottom line \\nperspective by Elkington (1998, 2013), that represents an accounting framework used for evaluating \\norganizational performance according to social, economic and environmental criteria.  \\nThe triple bottom line is regarde d by Vanclay (2004) both as a basis and a competing framework for social \\nimpact due to its content -related neutrality and broadness.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3 - Triple bottom line  \\n Overall, the concept of social impact departs both from that of social value given its specific reference to the \\nchanges generated by an organizations’  activity.  Moreover, the  concept of  social impact differs from that of \\n“impact”, given its non -neutral identity and its content. Thus, the concept of social impact canno t be merely \\nreduced to a definition deriving from an estimation methodology or a framework as the value -chain.  These \\nspecificities characterizing social impact open key challenges both in terms of its definition, identification and \\nmeasurement. Thus, the  next section looks more into detail to the concept of social impact and its definition.  \\n2.2 Defining social impact  \\nThe concept of social impact encompasses a wide variety of dimensions and perspectives. This has led to the \\ngeneration of multiple definitio ns and approaches to the concepts and to a wide debate on its definition.  A \\nkey set of definitions of social impact draws on the field of management, particularly referring to social \\nbusinesses and social entrepreneurship.   \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

       " Document(page_content='8 \\n \\nSocial impact refers to impacts  (or effects or consequences) that are likely to be experienced by an equally \\nbroad range of social groups as a result of some course of action.  Freudenburg (1986)  \\nSocial impacts are long term outcomes or program impacts follow from the benefits accrued t hrough the \\nintermediate outcomes. (McLaughlin & Jordan, 1999)  \\nSocial impacts are the wider societal concerns that reflects and respects the complex interdependency \\nbetween business practice and society. Gentile (2002)  \\nSocial impacts are intended and unintended social consequences, both positive and negative, of planned interventions (policies, programs, plans, projects) and any social change processes invoked by those interventions. Vanclay, (2003)  \\nSocial impact is the long -term sustainable and someti mes attributable change due to a specific \\nintervention or set of interventions.  Tuan for Gate Foundation, (2008)  \\nImpact only if it increases the quantity or quality of the enterprise’s social outcomes beyond what would \\notherwise have occurred (Brest & Bo rn, 2013)  \\nSocial impact as beneficial outcomes resulting from prosocial behavior that are enjoyed by the intended \\ntargets of that behavior and/or by the broader community of individuals, organizations, and/or \\nenvironments (Stephan et al., 2016)  \\nOverall, we  can say that these definitions refer to social impact as:  \\nThe sum of effects and changes (in terms of knowledge, skills, status, living conditions, values...) often \\ngenerated in the long term on the community by the activities of an organization .  \\n2.3 The  Key features of social impact: intentionality, measurability, additionality  \\nIt is possible to identify three key characteristics of organisations generating social impact:  \\n• Intentionality  \\nThis dimension refers to the explicit willingness of the organizatio n to address a solution to a social \\nproblem and pursue the generation of a positive social impact.  \\nIn this view, the social impact pursued by the organization aims at explicitly generating positive change in the \\nbehaviors or actions of the beneficiaries di rectly involved in the intervention and in the community ( Earl, \\nCarden, and Smutylo , 2001; Niggemann and Bragger, 2011; Chiappini, 2017; Alijania and Karyotisb, 2018 ).  \\nFor example, a banking organization which pursues micro -credit and impact investing str ategies intentionally \\npursues a social impact through its core activity.  In the case of impact investment, the concept of intentionality \\ncan be translated into an explicit \"ex -ante\" declaration and in the proactive research of activities aiming at \\ncreatin g social value through capital allocation by impact investors (Bugg -Levine and Emerson, 2011 ; Alijania \\nand Karyotisb, 2018).  \\n• Measurability  \\nThis dimension refers to the organisation’s capacity and need to account for its activities in \\nquantitative and qual itative terms.  \\nSocial impact has to be measurable and measured in a quantitatively and/or qualitatively way (O’Donohoe et \\nal. 2010;  Freirich and Fulton 2009; Hebb 2013). Social Impact Measurement is a system of trust (Nicholls, ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5. Sustainability and impact management and measurement.pdf', 'page': 7}, lookup_index=0),\n",
       " Document(page_content='9 \\n \\n2009), not only among the s ocial entities and their beneficiaries; indeed, it is a “moral obligation” of \\norganization with a social impact to be accountable of the social outcomes they generate ( Bengo et al., 2016).  \\n• Additionality   \\nThis dimension entails that social impact generate a  positive change in fields where market \\nmechanisms fail or only partially work.  \\nAdditionality is the less cited criteria into social impact definitions.  It refers to whether the intended impact \\nwould have occurred without the investment or the interventio n (So and Staskevicius, 2015). The intervention \\nor the investment has an impact only if it increases the social and/or environmental value beyond what would \\notherwise have occurred (Brest and Born, 2013; Lazzarini, et al., 2014).  \\n2.4 The challenges of ide ntifying the generated impact  \\nThe debated definition of impact, as was briefly presented above, implies some challenges related to its \\nidentification, characterization, and measurement. Above, impact was defined as the effects and changes “adjusted for what would have happened anyway, actions of others and for unintended consequences.” \\n(EVPA, 2013, p.9). Thus, from a theoretical point of view, to identify the generated impact it is necessary to isolate the effects of an intervention from other inter -related effects or changes that would have happened \\neven without the intervention.  \\nThe challenge of impact identification is twofold. On one side it concerns understanding what the effects on \\nspecific subjects would be (for instance, effects on a country, a co mmunity, a village, an individual) when the \\nsubject has been exposed to one specific intervention. On the other side, it is also related to understanding \\nwhat would have been the outcome for a specific subject if the subject had not been exposed to that specific intervention.  The challenges to impact identification come from the fact that we cannot be fully aware of the \\nconditions of treated individuals (or communities) in the absence of the treatment.  As pointed out by Gertler et al. (2016) the problem is  that “We typically observe people, either when they have been subject to the \\nintervention, or when they have not.” (Gertler et al., 2016, p.35).  \\nTo better understand the main challenges of impact identification, it is important to understand some key \\nconcepts that are strictly related to the concept of impact:  \\n• Deadweight \\n• Attribution  \\n• Displacement  \\n• Drop off  \\n• Externality/spillover  \\n• Negative impact \\nThese concepts are presented in the sections below.  \\n2.4.1 Deadweight \\nThe first concept we introduce is deadweight. Nicholls (2009) defines deadweight as “the extent to which \\noutcomes would have happened without any interventions by the organization” (figure 4). The Scottish \\nEnterprise Economic Impact Guidance also distinguishes between two different typolog ies of deadweight:  \\n• Activity (or output/outcome) deadweight is an assessment of whether the actual activity related to \\nthe project/activity/program would have gone ahead without intervention.

The attribution is \\nan assessment of how much of the outcome was caused by the considered intervention and not by other \\nfactors.  \\nThe concept of attribution is strict ly related to the wider concept of causality.  \\nIn the XVII the English Philosopher John Stuart Mill provided a theoretical formalization of the inductive \\napproach to “causality”, listing key necessary conditions for causality to happen as: temporal precede nce (X \\nprecedes Y), covariation (Y changes with X) and the absence of plausible alternative explanations.  \\nMackie 1974, p. 62 defined a “causa” as an “INUS condition” namely, “an insufficient but non redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient conditio n”.  \\nIn this regard, a short circuit can be an INUS condition for a house fire: … “Short circuits cause house fires is to \\nsay that the short circuit is an INUS condition for house fires. It is an insufficient part because it cannot cause \\nthe fire on its ow n (other conditions should be present). It is, nonetheless, a non- redundant part because, \\nwithout it, the rest of the conditions are not sufficient for the fire. It is just a part, and not the whole, of a \\nsufficient condition (which includes oxygen, the pr esence of inflammable material, etc.), but this whole \\nsufficient condition is not necessary, since some other cluster of conditions, for example, an arsonist with \\ngasoline, can produce the fire.” (Psillos, 2007, p. 126)  \\n“Attributing” means proving a causal  relationship between the change observed and the organization’s action, \\nprogram or policy.  Attribution appears as a key concept in impact identification and measurement.   \\nThree main problems (Nonie Impact Evaluation Guidance, 2015) must be faced to guar antee attribution in \\nimpact evaluation:  \\n• The establishment of a counterfactual, namely understanding what outcomes would have looked like in the absence of the intervention or policy or program (Ferraro, 2009).  \\n• The elimination of «selection effect”:  if the  beneficiaries of an intervention are not \\n“randomly” selected the inherent characteristics of the group selected for the treatment \\nmay bias the estimation of the impact of a treatment/intervention/program, potentially \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

In this analytical \\napproach the only difference existing between the two groups is that the control group has not been exposed \\nto the intervention.  \\n• An open issue concerns how to sel ect the control group. n the “differences in differences” design \\n(another quasi -experimental design) two different groups are compared before and after the \\ntreatment.

Displacement can be used to assess the ef fects of philanthropic or impact investing money.  There \\nis an effect of displacement when donors’ or investors’ money crowd out other money that would have \\ndelivered the same service (often, though not always, without philanthropic/impact investing dollar s) (Karlan \\net al., 2016). A classic example is a healthcare clinic funded by donors: that clinic may simply be replacing an \\nexisting clinic, perhaps private, that served roughly the same population with roughly the same quality of \\nservices. The “impact” of  those donor dollars is roughly zero (those patients would have gotten the same \\nquality of care anyway).  \\nDisplacement can be negative or positive. Negative displacement reduces the impact of the donor dollars, as \\nthe outcome would have happened anyway. Good displacement increases the impact of the donor/investors’ \\ndollars; by displacing programs that are havi ng little impact or doing harm. (Impact Matters, 2015). \\nDisplacement can be estimated through rigorous studies, but these studies are very seldom done on any social sector programs anywhere in the world.  \\nIn the absence of rigorous data, it is possible to make qualitative estimations through a “best guess” on a \\nparticular’s organization’s displacement, basing that guess on anecdotal information, non -counterfactual \\nsecondary data from studies, and general knowledge. Displacement (and externalities below) is often relatively apparent when it appears significant enough to be of concern. (Impact Matters, 2015). It can also be roughly \\nestimated ex post with a survey approach with specific questions designed in the form: “what would you have done if you had not ta ken this program”.  \\n2.4.4 Drop off  \\nWith the drop- off concept we describe the deterioration of an outcome over time. The concept relates to the \\nfact that over time the importance of the impact of a treatment decreases.  \\nThe organization should be aware of which beneficiaries are dropping off and if there are commonalities \\namong them. (EVPA,2013). The creation of «panel dataset», can be useful to monitor the potential impact \\ndrop off.  \\n4.5 Negative impact  \\nThe term «Negative impact» is an uncommon terminology especially if we adopt the first definition approach \\nto impact which is expressed in section 4.1 (effects and changes (in terms of knowledge, skills, status, living \\nconditions, values ...) generated in the long term on the community by the activities of an  organization.)  \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

       " Document(page_content='13 \\n \\nFrom a more methodological point of view, negative impact can be regarded as significant, proved and reverse \\neffect of an activity/program/policy with regard to pre -set objectives.  Consequently, the negative impact is a \\ndifferent concept from that of «nonresult» i.e. absence or non- significant effects of the intervention.  \\nGertler et al. 2016, in the World Bank Impact Evaluation Guide, provide practical indications for organizations \\nwhich have to cope with negative impact:  \\n “Understanding how the intervention was implemented is particularly crucial when evaluation results show a \\nlimited or negative impact. Nonresults or negative results are no reason to punish program or evaluation \\nmanagers. Rather, they provide an opportunity for program and evaluation managers to explain clearly what \\ndid not work as intended; that, in itself, can lead to large policy gains and should be rewarded.” (Gertler et al., \\n2016, p.218)  \\n2.4.6 Spillovers & Externalities  \\nA key challenge in the definition of social im pact and its measurement is that of distinguishing the actual \\n(social) impact of an intervention, an investment or a program from the externalities or spillovers it generates.  \\nThe concept of attribution allows to distinguish the concept of impact from tha t of externality/spillover.  The \\nconcepts of externality or spillover derive from the framework of neoclassical Economics.  \\nFrom a microeconomic market transaction perspective an “externality” is defined by Hutchinson (2016) as \\n“The effect of a market excha nge on a third party who is outside or “external” to the exchange. Because \\nexternalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved, they are sometimes called  \\nspillovers or externalities . Externalities can be negative or p ositive.”   \\nThe economist Daron Acemoglu defines spillovers as “as indirect effects of a treatment”. Externalities “ can \\nbias the direct effect, and/or they can be of economic interest themselves”  (Acemoglu et al ., 2017, p.13).  \\nThe difference between externality and impact creates important issues for impact evaluation, since the effect \\nof externalities is sometimes unknown or unpredictable ex -ante. Moreover, externalities can be both positive \\nand negative, leading to gains or losses in the efficacy and ef ficiency of an intervention (Bernheim and \\nWhinston,2001).  To measure externalities in practice, economists exploit a wide variety of different \\nmethodologies.  \\nOn one side quantitative methodologies rely on monetization. Through monetization techniques it i s possible \\nto quantify the value of an externality, estimating the cost of the damages product by the externality or the \\nsavings that the externality allows to obtain. Another potential and “reverse method” consists in the \\nmonetization of the cost required  to control the externality itself.  Moreover, other quantitative methods to \\nestimate externalities rely on econometric counterfactual analysis.  \\nIdentifying and accounting for Spillovers: two lessons from Development Economics  \\nKremer and Miguel (2004, 2007) provide a counterfactual impact evaluation of a deworming program \\nimplemented in the Primary Schools of Kenya. In the program 30.000 students were treated with deworming \\npills. The output of the intervention was made up by the number of delivered pills, the outcome by the \\ninfections reduction and the impact of the intervention by health and nutrition conditions improvement and \\neducational outcome. The experiment proved a positive effect on treated children.  \\nHowever, the evalu ation was not complete due to the presence of large externalities in health and in \\neducation. Actually, the fact that children received the pill and worm infections were reduced had fundamental \\neffects also over non treated children both attending the same  school of treated children both attending \\ndifferent schools closed to the treated ones.

       " Document(page_content='14 \\n \\nThe randomization of treatment intervention at school level allowed to catch important externalities across \\nschool and within schools. In this way the economists were  able to estimate the overall impact of the program. \\nCross school externalities were measured analyzing outcomes and impacts and exploiting exogenous variation in the closeness of control schools to treatment schools. On the contrary, within school externa lities have been \\nmeasured comparing outcomes and impacts on individuals displaying low or high compliance to the treatment.  \\nAlso Janseens (2004) offers an evaluation of a women empowerment program named “Mahikya Samakya”, \\nset in rural India. The impact evaluation study is provided with an analysis and an estimation of spillovers. In \\nthis case, in order to measure treatment spillovers, the authors implemented the survey both in treatment \\nand in control villages. Running the survey including also program non  participants, living in villages where the \\nprogram is effective appears as a fruitful way to identify and catch spillovers.  \\nSpillovers or Strategic Interactions?  \\nGoing beyond the identification of impact and of externalities/spillovers, Acemoglu et al., 2 017 distinguish \\nbetween the impact (direct effect) of a treatment, the pure spillover (externality) and the strategic interaction.  \\nAccording to Acemoglu et al. (2017), strategic interaction takes place when there are interactions between the direct effect s of a treatment (the impact) and the spillover effects. In the strategic interaction, the extent \\nof the spillover depends on the treatment status of a specific individual. Strategic interactions play a key role \\nin social innovation and social impact proce sses.  \\nSpillovers as unintended consequences  \\nA further perspective on externalities or spillovers, analyses these elements as the effects that come about as \\na result of an activity but that are not part of the desired and pre -set objectives.  In spite of no t having any \\ntheoretical formalization in academic literature, this approach is shared, as example, by the European Venture \\nPhilantrophy Association, which states that “By defining outcomes in line with objectives implies that an \\norganisation focuses on th e intended consequences of its interventions.” (EVPA, 2013, p.42).  \\nNonetheless, in spite of this focus, every intervention, policy, program displays a series of unintended \\nconsequences. According to the EVPA point of view, a part of the unintended conseque nces may be foreseen \\nby the organization because, although the results of the activities on a particular community or group are not \\nexplicitly intended, they appear as a clear result of the organization’s activities and hence they should be \\nfactored into the defined outcomes and assigned indicators.  \\nOther effects, which coincide with the spillover concept, may only manifest themselves once the activities of \\nthe organization are underway: for example, the beneficiaries of a treatment may respond to it in an \\nunexpected way, or the effects may reach more peripheral stakeholders than the forecasted direct \\nbeneficiaries. To pick up these unintended consequences, an organization should review its activities periodically as part of the monitoring and evaluation pro cess. In this perspective the absence of an explicit and \\nforecastable intention may be regarded as the distinguishing element between impact and externalities. \\nImpact to be identified ought to be distinguished from its unintended consequences.\\n  \\n3. Context and sustainability and impact management and measurement \\ndrivers  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement have become a topical theme. For this reason, it is \\ncrucial to consider the context in which and the reasons why sustainability and impact management and \\nmeasurement play a role in society.

These ar e generated by emerging social, economic, environmental and \\npolitical transformations which, in the last two years, have been exacerbated by the Covid -19 pandemic. Since \\nthe beginning of the century, our society has been characterized by new demographic tr ends such as an ageing \\npopulation, new forms of households, urbanizations and migration, among others. The sustainability of our \\nsociety (and of our planet at large) is also affected by climate change, which is causing economic losses and \\ngrowing demand fo r energy, food and water. These transformations are challenging existing welfare systems \\nand calling for new welfare and caring models that are able to tackle widening social exclusion and inequalities.  \\nTo address these challenges, different global initiatives to achieve sustainable development have been designed and implemented. Among the main recent ones, the most well recognised framework to \\ncommunicate objectives and results connected to economic, soc ial and environmental sustainability is the \\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  \\n \\nFigure 1 SDGs  \\nSDGs, which are framed within a wide program that encompasses 169 specifi c targets and a set off more than \\n240 indicators, have become the cornerstone for the development of many national and local strategies due to their universality, mutual interconnection and transformative power. The SDGs framework has also inspired differe nt methods and approaches to sustainability and impact measurement, all of which intended as a means \\nto demonstrate and monitor the achievement of specific development targets.  \\n3.2 Regulation  pressure  \\nIn recent years, there has been a law development, especially at European level, which aims to set out a regulatory framework for how market players - including investors and entrepreneurs -  shall operate in order \\nto be impactful and ESG compliant.  \\nBefore mentioning some of these measures, it is worth looking  briefly at the policy framework that has driven \\nsuch development. Europe’s orientation towards an impact economy has its roots in the Treaty on European Union and it has been reinforced through the European Pillar of Social Rights, according to which “pur suant \\nto Article 3 of the Treaty, the aims of the European Union are inter alia to promote the well -being of its peoples \\nand to work for the sustainable development of Europe based on a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment an d social progress. The Union shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

Subsequently, there has been a cascade of policy interventions, among \\nwhich the most relevant are the “European Commission Innovative Union Initiative & Social investment \\nPackage” (2010), the “Social Business Initiative -  SBI” (2011), the “EU Programme for Employment and Social \\nInnovati on - EaSI” (2013) , the “European Fund for Strategic Investments -  EFSI” (2014), also known as the \\nJuncker Plan, the “Social Impact Accelerator -  SIA” (2015), and, in more recent times, the “Action Plan on \\nFinancing Sustainable Growth” (2018) , the “Europea n Green Deal”  (2019) , the EU Taxonomy (2020), the Social \\nTaxonomy (2021) and the European Social Economy Action Plan ( 2021 ). All these initiatives have stimulated \\nthe market to adopt social innovation solutions as a resource for growth and jobs, mobilisin g private investors \\nas well as social entrepreneurs, and creating the basis for a favourable legal environment.  \\nFollowing such policy development, the European Union has defined common rules and a regulatory perimeter \\nto drive the ESG and an impact econom y market, covering both the financial and corporate sector through, \\nfor instance, benchmarks, standards and obligations of corporate due diligence, disclosure and reporting.  For \\nexample, EU Reg. 346/2013 “on European social entrepreneurship funds” has est ablished the so -called \\n“EuSEF” funds, dedicated to social entrepreneurship, for the promotion of investments in companies that has \\n“the achievement of measurable, positive social impacts as its primary objective in accordance with its articles \\nof associati on, statutes or any other rules or instruments of incorporation”. This intervention sets out the \\nobligation for fund managers to adopt procedures to define the extent to which target companies achieve the expected (positive) social impact and to communicat e to their investors the method used to measure such \\noutcomes. More recently, EU Reg. 2088/2019 “on sustainability -related disclosures in the financial services \\nsector” (so called \"SFDR Regulation\") has introduced specific disclosure requirements with rega rds to the \\nsustainability risks of financial products; the SFDR was then complemented by EU Reg. 852/2020 which \\nestablishes “a framework to facilitate sustainable investment” (the so -called \"Taxonomy Regulation\").   \\nIt is interesting to note that these rec ent legislative developments intervene and complement the non -\\nfinancial reporting pursuant to Directive 2013/34/EU, for example by including in the non -financial statement \\nthe extent to which companies\\' activities are associated with environmentally sustai nable economic activities.  \\nAt the same time, even if the combined two regulations are currently focused on environmental aspects, their \\nscope is expected to be further extended by including \"social\" objectives. Furthermore, with specific reference \\nto pens ion funds, Directive (EU) 2016/2341 specifically designed for pension funds includes considerations “on \\nenvironmental, social and governance factors related to investment assets in investment decisions”.  \\nFinally, it is essential to consider the legal fram ework also in its formation, namely looking ahead and \\nconsidering the ongoing legal initiatives that are expected to materialize as effective and binding legislative acts. This regulatory path has already been marked by the: (i) recent European Parliament resolution with \\nrecommendations to the European Commission on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability (with \\nreference to ESG, value chain and Business Human Rights due diligence); (ii) proposal for a European legal act \\non \"sustainable governan ce\" that incorporates sustainability issues in companies, for example by redefining \\nfiduciary duties of directors and the concept of corporate “social interest”.  \\nFrom the above, it is evident that the European legislator is focusing on impact assessment a nd measurement \\nthrough disclosure obligations with the objective of leading market actors towards a sustainable transition. Essentially, the legal system discussed so far aims to provide clarity and common rules for such transition and, \\nin turn, prevent im pact and green washing, which are those practices that threaten the integrity of the \\nsustainability framework and expose market operators to reputational and legal risks.  \\nThis regulatory evolution is also widening the access of consumers, and stakeholders  in general, to remedies. \\nMore precisely, such regulatory changes at European level are providing stakeholders with the legal capacity \\nof invoking liability of companies and funds for not fulfilling sustainability obligations. For example, human \\nrights, ad equate responses to the climate crisis or avoidance of green and impact washing business practices.  ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

       " Document(page_content='17 \\n \\nIt is evident that companies and financial actors should adapt to the new regulatory frameworks, possibly \\nanticipating any regulatory trends. Adopting adequate legal safeguards should not exclusively result into a \\nmere compliance activity, but also into a full integration of impact and ESG measurement into the core \\nbusiness. This would allow companies to avoid legal and reputational risks and at the same time  - as a \\nconsequence and with effects on a strategic level -  ensure an advantage over competitors, also in terms of \\nattracting investments and anticipating market trends.  \\n3.3 New hybrid actors and finance for impact  \\nThe emergence of new social needs, pressing societal and environmental  challenges and the evolution of new \\neconomic paradigms, prompted the development of new organizational forms that aim to address new global social, political, and economic trends. These  organizations adopt innovative  business models by blending \\nsocial, environmental  and economic purposes and generating impact as part of their core activities. These \\norganizations, known as “hybrid organizations”, aim to fill the gap between purely philanthropic organizations \\n(e.g., traditional third sector organizations and charities) and  purely commercial ventures.  Hybrid \\norganisations are characterized by a varied stakeholder profile; their governance structure includes multiple \\nstakeholders, and their a ctivities have an effect on a broad range of different actors (e.g. beneficiaries, \\ncustomers, funders and employees). All these stakeholders often have different needs and \\nexpectations  (Dohrmann et al., 2015;\\u202fHockerts, 2015; Santos et al., 2015). Moreover,  hybrid organizations \\nhave to balance between the achievement of both social and environmental mission and profit generation. Thus, the question is how hybrid organizations can integrate, manage and prove their hybridity.  \\n \\nFigure 2 Hybrid organisations spectrum  \\nThe global financial crisis in 2007 has also led to re -thinking financial innovation processes (Khraisha  and Artur, \\n2018) and pursuing innovative financing (Sandor et al, 2009). Since 2007, considerable efforts have been made to reform the financial system and make it more innovative, democratic and inclusive (Kim and Hann, 2019), \\nby also rediscovering the importance of the ESG dimensions for the economic and financial system (Chapra, 2014). Over the years, the market has sta rted to realize how shareholder wealth maximization is no longer a \\nvalid guide for the creation of sustainable wealth (Fatemi  and Fooladi, 2013). This has led a paradigm shift that \\nstirred the  development  of various model of sustainable finance.  Moreover, traditional rating players have \\nentered the market, with some recent important operations such as Moody’s acquisition of a majority stake in Vigeo Eiris as well as S&P Global’s purchase of the ESG business of RobecoSAM. Even if this market expansion is con tributing to let the ESG ratings and rankings entering the mainstream finance, some concerns on data \\nquality and integration with traditional financial reporting and research are still concerning main players. Company level ESG ratings from different ratin g agencies show low correlations due to differences in their \\nmethodologies. In this context, the ESG criteria are differently combined with financial expectations of the \\ninvestors. For example, the concept of impact finance refers to the deployment of fina ncial resources primarily \\nfor generating impact on the ESG components, as well as in some cases, a financial  return.  Conversely, ESG \\ncomponents can be measured just to mitigate the risks of unexpected events that may affect the financial performance of the  investments. Impact investors aim to allocate their financial resources to investments that \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

The problem is, therefore, how to combine confli cting logics in the same entity, and thus how to make \\nsure impact investors can measure and demonstrate the impact generated by their investments while \\nachieving expected financial performances.  \\n \\nFigure 3 - Impact finance spectrum  \\n4. Approaches, methods and metrics evolution  \\nAs detailed above, the evolution of sustainability and impact management and measurement is strictly related \\nto the social and environmental challenges and the different ways impact organisations try to address  them. \\nWe argue that the best approaches to measure and manage impact are the ones that overcome the risk of impact washing. This type of phenomenon is today challenged by both organizations’ stakeholders (more and more sensitive to environmental and socia l issues) and new laws and regulations that try to limit these kinds \\nof distortion and by driving companies towards an increased sustainability. In sum, organizations are \\nincreasingly required to show sound evidence of the impacts they can create and how t hese impacts are \\nevidenced.  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement practices can have implications for organizations in terms of communication, identity and transaction . \\nCommunication  \\nAmong the multiple drivers that can lead an organization to develop or adopt an approach to measure impact, \\nthe need of communication, or reporting, is certainly one of the most widespread. The chosen measurement \\napproach can lead to different kind of communication. Investment funds, for example, manage the \\nmeas urement of impacts of their investees to properly communicate with shareholders or to comply with \\nmandatory institutional regulations. Organizations can have different communication objectives. They can \\nassess their social, environmental and economic perfo rmances in order to be transparent with their \\nstakeholders. In this case, the impact measurement practice is used with an informative scope. Alternatively, \\norganizations may want to communicate externally their strategic positioning with respect to sustain able or \\nimpact objectives and align internally the organizational values to these goals. Lastly, impact measurement \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5. Sustainability and impact management and measurement.pdf', 'page': 17}, lookup_index=0),\n",
       " Document(page_content='19 \\n \\ncan be also used to communicate the impact strategies internally, to the staff and other internal stakeholders, \\nto improve impact management  processes and grow in terms of impact generation.  \\nIdentity  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement practices can contribute to build an organization’s \\nidentity. Measurement can enhance the identity of organizations, investors or funds, in te rms of their \\npropensity for integrating sustainability and impact in their business proposition. Thus, sustainability and \\nimpact management and measurement can have different results. Organizations that focus on demonstrating \\ntheir social and commercial pe rformances can use measurement tools to build on their own image as \\nresponsible entities to their stakeholders. Moving from a purely external approach to an internally driven \\nmanagerial perspective on assessing social and environmental effectiveness, the i mage concept can evolve \\ninto identity. An organization that integrates impact measurement practices into its strategy and decision -\\nmaking processes can concretely become a responsible entity and build its identity in this direction. Moreover, \\nif an organization integrates impact measurement tools into its operational processes, it could be able to \\nstrengthen its identity and become a transformative actor able to solve societal challenges.  \\nTransaction  \\n“Principal -agent” relationship between two or more stake holders (investors and investees, social enterprises \\nand their clients and beneficiaries) can be affected by sustainability and impact management and \\nmeasurement practices in terms of: managing the level of information asymmetry, the bargaining power, the \\nrisks of moral hazard and mission drift. In this case, the negotiations among stakeholders and the final \\narrangement depends on the bargaining power of different parties. This process may lead to mission -drift: for \\nexample, social enterprises may have to d ivert from their social -oriented purposes to meet the expectations \\nof business -related stakeholders. In the finance context, the risk of mission drift is higher when investors \\nrequire their investees to perform an ex -post measurement of the impacts criteri a (e.g., ESG criteria). On the \\ncontrary, mission -drift is less likely when investors and investees define ex -ante their impact goals and impact \\ncriteria (e.g., ESG) and coherently integrate them into contractual agreements and investment performance \\nmonito ring systems. Lastly, this type of relationships negotiated through impact management and \\nmeasurement may also generate a new set of impact measurement practices, which are relational and non -\\ntransactional in nature and entail an evolving and ongoing mutua l learning process (Chen and Harrison, 2020). \\nThis is the case when the organizations actively engage with their stakeholders to improve their benefits, on \\nthe basis of impact goals and scalable targets.  \\nWe propose here a taxonomy of existing approaches to  sustainability and impact management and \\nmeasurement as outlined in the figure below.

Proving sustainability practices de monstrate, in an informative way, the overall performances of \\nan organization and enable its legitimacy to external audiences. This model, which is conceptually related to \\nnon-financial disclosure practices, aims at better defining an organization’s image as a responsible entity. For \\nexample, in the finance world, this practice is used to manage negotiations between investors and investees, \\nin that the investor requires the investee to report ex -post how ESG risks of their businesses are managed. In \\nthis se nse, proving sustainability practices are mainly underpinned by a logic of compliance and are usually \\ntranslated by organizations into reporting non -financial performances. Accordingly, the measurement of \\nimpact takes a narrative shape in organizations’ re porting practices. These practices disclose information \\nmostly at an output level, thus avoiding picturing a trajectory of outcomes and impact directly attributed to \\norganizations’ activities.  \\nThe main instrument through which organizations communicate their socially responsible behaviour to \\ndifferent stakeholders is the Sustainability Report, that must be comprehensive and representative of the relevant issues affecting a company and its sector, as well as functional to the informative needs of the \\ndiffer ent stakeholders.  Sustainability Reports are produced on a voluntary basis, except for large companies \\nor groups of companies. Another option is to develop an Integrated Report, in which companies’ financial \\nstatements and non -financial information (enviro nmental, social and governance issues) are merged into a \\ndescriptive sustainability report.  To produce a report, organizations usually adopt available standards that \\nprovide a benchmarking tool for communicating with external stakeholders in an open, balan ced and \\nconsistent manner. This is done by organizations to strengthen or maintain credibility and provide assurance \\nof practices through independent certification.  \\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a non -financial disclosure methodology that ensur es organizations’ \\naccountability to internal and external stakeholders in terms of environmental, social and governance \\nperformances. The GRI is an approach adopted mostly by listed companies and is used as a tool to adhere to regulatory compliance mechani sms. It supports organizations with disclosing information on how business \\nmodels operate in terms of specific social and environmental outputs. Similar to financial reporting practices, \\nthe GRI embraces an ex -post valuation approach, mostly due to complia nce issues.   \\nThe ESG approach is another important model which can broadly fall within Proving sustainability approaches \\nto measuring and reporting the sustainability and impact of an organization.

While non -financial organizations broadly adopt ESG frameworks as non -financial disclosure \\npractice, financial institutions may instead make use of ESG frameworks in dif ferent and more complex ways. \\nMore precisely, ESG frameworks have witnessed important advances in the financial sector, in that financial \\ninstitutions have progressively adapted ESG frameworks to different and more robust approaches to impact \\nmeasurement a nd management. The GRI standards and the ESG approach are briefly presented in Annex 1&2.  \\nProving sustainability models have implication in terms of communication, identity and transaction as outlined \\nin the following table:  \\nCommunication  An organizatio n communicates (both internally and externally) its results only with an \\ninformative scope  \\nIdentity  Measurement aims to build an organization\\'s image as a responsible entity  \\nTransaction  Investors require investees to perform ex -post measurement of results  \\nTable 2 - Proving sustainability implications  \\n4.2 Aligning with societal grand challenges  \\nThis category includes approaches entailing more robust systems of impact management than those of Proving \\nSustainability. In this type of models, practices interpret sustainability from a \"nice to have\" to a \"must have”. In this context, measurement of impact emerges not only from a narrative perspective, but also from the \\nidentification and disclosure of a set of overarching social and environmental challenges that need to be \\naddressed. In this context, the alignment with societal grand challenges has been regarded by scholars as a \\nmethod of disclosure that helps boost corporate sustainability credibility because it ensures a link be tween \\nthe outputs and impacts (Ferraro et al. 2015). In this type of methodologies, the focus is on stimulating \\ncompanies to align the assessment of their internal management and decision -making practices with their \\ncontributions to the most urgent social and environmental needs. Organizations that adopt these \\nmethodologies coherently picture their interests and strategies with broader objectives. They also provide a \\ndisclosure mechanism that is characterized by understanding, managing and communicating the  social and \\nenvironmental objectives which align with their organizational practices and function.   \\nThese approaches enable organizations to communicate, externally, their strategic positioning with respect to \\nsustainable or impact objectives while aligning, internally, their organizational values to these goals. Moving \\nfrom a purely external legitimacy approach of narrating social impact, these methodologies stimulate an \\ninternally driven managerial perspective on assessing social effectiveness. In this context, there is a shift from \\ncommunicating ethical and responsible behaviour for a matter of reputation to a proper concept of organizational identity that is oriented towards sustainable development. Through these types of \\nmethodologies, organizations integrate the vision of contributing to societal grand challenges in their \\nstrategies and decision -maki ng processes. For example, compared to Proving sustainability processes, A ligning \\nwith societal grand challenges approaches to measuring and managing impact require organizations to \\nnegotiate ex -ante common goals and targets that should be aligned to the p erformance monitored and \\nmeasured ex post.   \\nThe impact management and measurement standards which fall within aligning to societal gran challenges \\nmethodologies are tools that support organizations with converging towards the SDGs. The SDGs can help a \\ncomp any or a whole sector align their social and environmental outputs with one or more SDGs. The SDG \\nImpact Standards (see annex 3 for detailed information) are a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of social \\nand environmental outputs that can be applied by most organizations to identify their specific contributions \\nto one or more SDGs. They provide actionable guidance for embedding social and environmental objectives \\ninto an organization’s strategy and influencing decision -making and risk management proc esses.

According to these approaches, impact is the change in a social, environmental or \\neconomic outcome caused by an  organization and it is characterized by three key features: intentionality, \\nmeasurability and additionality. Intentionality  refers to the explicit willingness of an organization to address a \\nsolution to a social problem and pursue the generation of a posi tive social impact. Measurability  refers to the \\norganization’s capacity and need to account for its social -oriented activities in quantitative and qualitative \\nterms. Additionality  entails that social impact generates a positive change in fields where marke t mechanisms \\nfail or only partially work. When organizations attempt to pursue these three features, their communication \\nstrategies are driven by impact generation aims. This implies that organizations define a robust sustainability and impact management a nd measurement process of analysis, monitoring, measurement and management \\nof the short, medium and long term effects of their activities on the community in relation to the identified \\nobjectives. For example, in the finance sector, this process supports i nvestees and investors with: (i) agreeing \\non and aligning internal practices with ex -ante defined overarching societal goals; (ii) translating such goals \\ninto impact action to better inform decisions and drive activity and investment capital to where it is  needed.  \\nAccording to Generating impact methodologies, the impact management and measurement of an organization’s activities is built around communicating impact strategies internally, to the staff and other \\ninternal stakeholders, with the aim of improving  impact management processes and internalizing a culture of \\nimpact generation. Furthermore, organizations that adopt methodologies that integrate impact measurement \\ntools into their operational processes are also able to strengthen their identity of transf ormative actors \\npotentially able to solve societal challenges. Oftentimes, this typology of approaches emerges from the \\nnegotiation process between organizational stakeholders. This process, which is relational and non -\\ntransactional in nature and based on mutual learning, can lead to choosing impact measurement practices \\nthat best fit the interests of all the actors involved in an organization (Chen and Harrison, 2020).  \\nThe standards for Impact generating approaches are those in which outputs, outcomes and impact are all \\nlinked by an ex -ante defined Theory of Change. Theory of Change is the logic model that supports organizations \\nwith identifying what environmental and social impact can be generated or achieved by their specific activities \\n(Ebrahim and Rang an 2014). It implies the creation of a dashboard of KPIs that derive from the activities of an \\norganization and are strictly connected to overarching impact objectives. A Theory of Change is defined as the causal connection between activities and results ( in the form of output, outcome and impact measures). Such \\nmeasures will then be translated into a range of qualitative and quantitative indicators, depending on the scope and depth of analysis.  Theory of Change should integrate intentionality, measurabili ty and additionality \\nin organizations’ logic models. This means that the activities of an organization should intentionally aim at \\ncertain measurable performances and impacts, possibly in contexts where they are needed the most \\n(additionality).

Sustainability and impact management and measurement process  \\n5.1 Process for companies \\nAs seen throughout this chapter, sustainability and impact management and measurement is an important \\nand complex theme, which involve various actors with different objectives in different contexts. In this context, \\nto manage their impact, organizations need a structured process that is able to cover the di fferent objectives \\nand needs related to the generation of positive impact and the mitigation of negative effects. Recently, there \\nhas been considerable progress in developing measurement and evaluation methods, with numerous approaches being developed by practitioners, foundations and impact investors (Ebrahim and Rangan, 2014). \\nThese efforts have led to a great heterogeneity among sustainability and impact measurement models. Some \\nmodels are focused more on one specific aspect of the sustainability and imp act management and \\nmeasurement process. For example, there are models that help an organization align impact with strategies or activities (e.g., IFC’s Operating Principles for Impact Management, Principles for Responsible Investment \\nand Principles for Res ponsible Banking, among others). Other models provide specific sectoral metrics to \\nassess impact (e.g., IRIS+, GRI, SASB standards, among others), while some other models are focused on impact \\nevaluation and communication (e.g., SROI, Impact Weighted Finan cial Account, among others). Nevertheless, \\nseveral models (e.g., Dalberg Approach, EPIC’s Long Term Value Framework, EY Total Value, Impact Multiple \\nof Money, SDGs Compass, Social Impact Assessment, Social return of investment,  among the others) have \\nsimilarities and common points, which make it possible to define a generic process for the management and \\nmeasurement of the impact. This process follows eight interrelated steps.  Each step is briefly explained as \\nfollows\\n. \\nObjective Definition: This is the first step of the process. The Organization should define the objective of the \\nmeasurement (e.g. measure to communicate or measure to improve the impact generation), the unit of \\nanalysis (the organization should want to measure a specific project or strategy, or the impact generated by \\nthe enterprise as a whole) and the available resources in order to schedule a feasible plan of implementation.  \\nContext and Materiality analysis: in this step the organization should analyse the social needs it wants to ta ckle \\nand their relevance related to the context in which it operates. In doing so, the organisations should analyse \\nits stakeholders and could also identify and map the current and potential high impact areas connected to its \\nbusiness.  \\nStrategic Alignment:  the organization define its sustainable or impact statement and mission, aligning its \\nstrategies and processes. In order to do so, the organization could refer to principle like the SDGs principles, the ESG principles, the Principle for Responsible financ e or investment, etc.  \\nImpact Pathways (Social value chain): in this phase there is the analysis of the value creation process. The \\norganization should understand in which way it is generating impact for the society, how its activity and output can generate outcomes and impacts.  The main tool used in this phase is the social value chain.  \\nIndicators and metrics definition: here the organisation has to define in which way it is going to assess its \\nimpacts.  Is it going to use custom or standard indicators, qu antitative or qualitative, or a mix of the two? Is it \\ngoing to monetize all the impact, or just a part of it, if none? Is it possible to define a control sample or is there a benchmark with which compare the results?  \\nData Collection and Analysis: with this  step there is the definition of the sources of information and data \\nrequired for the analysis of the indicator, the collection tool and the timing of the gathering activities. Once the data are collected, it is time for the analysis and the evaluation of the impact.  ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

       " Document(page_content='28 \\n \\nAssurance and Communication: in this phase the organization should consider the assurance of the results, \\nhow to ensure the validity of the entire evaluation process and the best communication strategy to \\ndisseminate the results.  \\nIntegrating in  Operational and strategic process: last, but not least, in order to improve the impact generation, \\nto manage it and to guarantee the endogenization of the impact, the organization should define an action plan to integrate the impact evaluation at a strate gic level and in the organisation long term decision process.  \\n \\nTable 7 - Sustainability and impact management and measurement process for companies \\nIt is important to bear in mind that this is an ‘ideal’ process for managing and me asuring impact. This means \\nthat not all organisations would follow all the steps, because management and measurement models do not \\nnecessarily cover all these activities.  \\n5.2 Process for finance  \\nSimilar to companies, no consensus exists on what ideal process investors should follow to manage their \\nimpact. As such, the one presented here represents an ideal flow of an investment process designed to \\nincorporate impact management and measurement from  the very initial search for investment opportunities \\nto the final divestment operations.   \\nIn general, investment processes (including non-impact  ones too) are divided into phases that are, more or \\nless, always the same when considering equity operations:  initially, investment opportunities are sought in the \\nsectors of interest to the investor, and then the most interesting ones are chosen through a screening phase; \\nsubsequently, there is a due diligence phase that ensures the eligibility of the operation and then the actual \\ninvestment, which continues and is monitored for a certain period of time (usually years) until the investor exits the operation.  \\nIdeally, in the case of impact investments, the investment process should be structured to  go hand in hand \\nwith the  impact management and measurement activities.  All the investment phases should in fact be \\ndesigned to keep track of and maximise the  desired social and/or environmental impact, with the support \\nof internationally  recognised  methods  offering  princ iples,  frameworks,  standards  and metrics  serving  differe\\nnt purposes:  defining  expected impacts,  outlining  and aligning outcome and  impact indicators,  collecting \\ndata,  and finally  assessing impact in order to communicate  it to the outside world.     \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

       " Document(page_content='29 \\n \\nThe origination  phase  of the investment process  is key to defining and incorporating impact principles into the \\ninvestment strategy: the three key pillars forming the Impact Triad  - intentionality, measurability and \\nadditionality - guide the search for investment opportunities, which are selected among those showing from \\nthe very beginning  a potential effective contribution to one, or preferably more, SDGs.    \\nThe screening  stage involves a preliminary feasibility analysis of the investment opportunities identified in the \\nprevious phase.  Here,  a preliminary analysis  of the investment opportunities based on  ESG criteria is \\nperformed to assess whether such investments can actually qualify as  sustainable . More precisely, an ESG Acid \\nTest is performed:  this assesses, qua ntitatively, the degree to which the investment considers potential risks \\noccurring across ESG criteria and makes a positive contribution to a number of macro -themes selected in the \\nESG area1. If the ESG Acid Test  is positive, the investment is eligible fo r generating value out of ESG criteria. To \\nensure this,  it is verified that the principles of the Impact Triad are met and that the SDGs previously \\ndetermined are consistently addressed.    \\nFor those investment opportunities that are considered worth pursui ng, a specific assessment, the Social and \\nEnvironmental Impact Due Diligence , will be carried out to estimate and quantify the potential impact of the \\ninvestment.  Here,  the design of the impact measurement and management takes the lead:  the logic model of \\nimpact generation is built through a  Theory of Change , which describes how and why a project is supposed to \\nlead to a desired impact (environmental and/or social).  \\nIn the actual  investment  phase,  it is fundamental to guarantee  the full integration of impa ct criteria into the \\ninvestment agreement.  For this purpose, KPIs -  at output, outcome and impact level  – are defined, together \\nwith the  related achievement targets.  International frameworks such as, for example,  GIIN’s  IRIS Catalog  of \\nMetrics  and IRIS+ Co re Metrics Sets  are usually adopted during this phase to  support standardisation  and to \\nensure  comparability  in terms of  communication of impact results.   \\nThe monitoring  phase  aims to track progress against previously determined impact targets  (KPIs).  This stage is \\nalso dedicated to supporting the verification of the achievement of impact objectives, highlighting any \\ndeviation between predetermined targets and actual results.  Such verification  can be carried out at different \\nintervals: usually a period be tween six months and a year is chosen.   \\nFinally, in the final stage of  divestment , the impact results obtained through the investment are quantified, \\nwith a final  Impact  Report indicating whether the investment was successful or not.  Since it is fundamenta l to \\nconsider that actual impact objectives, intended as the portion of the total outcome that occurred as a direct result of the intervention,  are reachable and  assessable only in the long term,  it is important that the \\nimpactful activities initiated by t he investment continue after its closure. For this purpose,  the final Impact \\nReport should include  mission -lock clauses  that guarantee the preservation of the social and/or environmental \\nimpact results of the initiative even after its  disposal  by the inves tor. \\n  ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

Impact measurement: methodological issues  \\nAs seen throughout this chapter, accounting for impact requires organizations to make strategic measurement \\nchoices. Whether attempting to prove their sustainability, align  with societal grand challenges or generate \\nimpact, organizations that approach imp act measurement models and standards inevitably embark on a \\nresearch process, which can be contentious and debated (Scriven, 2013) . Differently from more general \\napplied research projects (e.g. explorator y studies), measuring impact is all about making  causal / attributional \\nclaims (i.e. causality or causation)  (Donaldson et al. , 2009) . The robustness of cau sal claims has for long \\ncoincided with robustness of methods, with traditional social experiments being at the top of a hierarchy of \\nevidence  (Craig et al. , 2008; Shadish et al. , 2002) . However, as social interventions are needing more \\ncompound explanations to respond to increasingly multifaceted social and environme ntal issues (McHugh et \\nal., 2017; O’Mara -Eves et al., 2013) , such hierarchy has been put into question (Nathanson, 2007; Petticrew, \\n2011) , especially when applied to innovative organizations that operate in open society (Bertotti et al. , 2018; \\nCaló et al. , 2019; Picciotto, 2012; Rifkin, 2014; Van Belle et al. , 2016) .  \\nThe raising of concerns about the role of traditional experimentalism in measuring impact has shifted \\ndiscourses about causality from being mono -paradigmatic instances to becoming pluralistic and \\nmethodological (Gates and Dyson, 2017) . Appr oaching impact measurement and enacting approaches and \\nstandards  now requires practitioners and academics to posit questions about (a) what reality is ( ontology ), (b) \\nhow to make sense of it ( epistemology or what constitutes scientific knowledge), and the extent to which \\ncausal claims should be retained from a value viewpoint ( axiology ) (Cartwr ight, 2007) . In the light of this \\nheterogeneous understanding of causality, measuring impact now represents a plethora of possibilities, all of which with different understandings of causality that vary by \\nresearch paradigms .   \\nResearch paradigms can be  understood as a set of assumptions and beliefs from which causal claims about \\nreality are generated. Paradigms guide the study of any phenomena. In the realm of impact studies, paradigms \\ndetermine:  \\n• researchers’ ontological commitments to generalisable ex planations of interventions (i.e., theory ); \\n• how generalisable explanations are inferred (i.e., inferential thinking  or inference ); \\n', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

This paradigm promotes a successionist understanding of causality , in \\nthat reality is seen as a stable and regular succession of events that follow a law-like logic  and deterministi cally \\ngovern human actions (Bryman, 2012) . At an epistemological level, positivism recognises that the truth about \\nthe world (and therefore interventions) can be pursued scientifically through direct observations  of these \\nregular empirical manifestations (Denzin, 2010) . For historical positivists, causal explanation is however \\nontologically inaccessible  per se  (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) . In historical positivists’ view, theory  should hold \\ntrue and value -free only when direct observation of empirical events verifies the presence of a constant \\nconcurrence of two or more events (e.g. X follows Y, therefore e very X follows Y ) (Mohr, 2009) . With theory \\nbeing confined to the status of direct product of empirical scrutiny, positivists rely on epistemic primacy  (i.e., ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

RCTs are  experimental designs through which researchers control for any external \\nsources of variations that may confound interventions’ impacts on study units such people, animals, \\ninstitutions. Interventions’ impacts are isolated from external disturbance via randomization, whereby \\ndifferent conditions (i.e., different interventions and lack thereof) are assigned to study units by chance (e.g. \\nby coin toss or table of random numbers)  to create groups that are comparable at baseline (i.e. before an \\nintervention) but that undergo different conditions (Shadish et al. , 2002) . Then, conditions are contrasted by \\ncalculating the differences between impact study units’ outc ome responses (i.e., counterfactual inference - \\nwhat would happen if the intervention was not there). More precisely, any differences between the groups that are observed once the impact study is completed are then likely to be attributed to the interventi on of \\ninterest and not to confounding effects (Banerjee et al. , 2015) . In such a vein, RCT researchers verify the \\neffectiveness of an intervention by suppressing any contextual va riation regardless of its theoretical \\nimportance.  \\nRCTs require  data that are quantifiable . These are mostly collected through universally  validated scales  or \\nobjective measurements  (e.g., blood samples, monitoring of physical activity, financial transacti ons) of \\noutcomes of interest and, less frequently, through researchers’ own scales. Scales and objective measurements generate quantifiable information that undergo \\nstatistical analysis  through techniques such as \\nt-tests  and forms of  multilevel regression analyses  to account for subgroup differences.  \\nForms of impact measurement that are purely underpinned by tenets of historical positivism are nowadays very rare (Bonell  et al. , 2018) . There is evidence that historical positivism plays a redundant role in recent \\nforms of impact measurement that uses new forms of social experimentation, including more theoretically -\\ndriven RCTs (Corry et al. , 2019) . The role of historical positivism has however been critical for the development \\nof other logics of enquiry that have guided impact measurement and causality attribution. These include social \\nconstructivist, postpositivist and critical realist responses to (or critiques of) historical positivism.  \\n6.2 Post -positivism: falsification, deduction, new social experimentations  \\nHistorical positivism has been highly critiqued for its internal inconsistencies. These critiques have been moved \\nby authors that the literature labels as empirical post- positivists (Corry et al. , 2019) . Among t hese authors, the \\nphilosopher of science Karl Popper (1902 -1994) conceptualised historical positivism’s inconsistencies as lying \\nin the false assumption that knowledge is an inductive and empirical process of hypothesis verification \\n(Popper, 2005) . The main challenge Popper presented to historical positivists’ statements about causality was \\nthat if any observed successions of regular events is held as verified theory, then science will never be able to \\noffer generalisable explanations (Popper, 2005) . In Popper’s view, the process of verification implies uncritical \\nacceptance of theories because sensory information remains decontextualised (i.e.  the questions scientists \\nask, how the world is observed and measured) and, thus, subject to external validity issues (Popper, 2013) .  \\nBy placing importance on the context of empirical observation, Popper advocated for a theory -laden science , \\nwhereby observations and experimentation can only come after thorough consideration of what theories tell \\nus about the world, so that tested theorie s can be externally valid (Popper, 2013) . In Popper’s view, causality \\nis pursued via falsification and deductive reasoning , whereby hypotheses  are constructed via careful evidence d-\\nbased theorizing  and, then, tested through observations and social experimentation (Popper, 2014) . In such \\nan approach, Popper recognized that ontological empiricism, value -free knowledge and empirical facts are \\ncontingent upon researchers’ action (Corry et al. , 2019) , and that the  constant conjunctions between facts can \\nno longer be the starting point to explain interventions (Bonell et al. , 2012) .

In the wake of Popper’s thoughts, impact studies have witnessed new \\ncomplex forms for social experimentation  which, for  being considered particularly suitable \\nto explain complex and innovative interventions, finds now plain legitimacy in policy (Bonell et al. , 2012) . These \\nforms of theory -engaged social experimentation include new- generation:  \\n• RCTs using theories of change and qualitative study components;  \\n• quasi -experiments (including natural experiments);  \\n• nonexperimental or observational  studies .  \\nAll these types of studies, differently from historical positivist RCTs, rely on the principle of falsification, and make use of ext ensive theory to rule out as many as alternative explanations as possible instead of confirming \\njust one hypothesis (Shadish et al. , 2002) .  \\nRCTs which respond to post -positivist tenets nowadays widely used in impact studies. These new- generation \\nRCTs, which preserve most of the underpinning features of historical positivist randomized experiments (i.e., randomization, control over units’ exposure to interventions; suppression of confounding effects), have been \\nre-examined by scholars and  adapted to more complex forms of interventions that operate across different \\ncontextual conditions and that can have multiple explanations. RCTs of this kind, for example those promoted \\nby the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), are guided by initial \\ntheor ies of change , and are supported through \\nqualitative data to identify all the contextual conditions that may account for variation of impact across \\nconditions of interest (Craig et al. , 2008) . In other words, these types RTCs aim to falsify, theoretically, all the \\npotential explanations of impacts before measuring and isolating the actual impacts of inter ventions.  \\nQuasi -experiments  are impact measurement design features that, similar to RCTs, seek to follow a counter \\nfactual logic, but they lack randomization. More intuitively, quasi -experiments deal with self-selection or \\nnatural occurring contrasts betw een conditions  (e.g. before and after covid),  in that units that do (not) undergo \\na specific condition can be compared, alternatively:  \\n• within the same group ( before and after quasi -experiments );  \\n• between groups ( controlled quasi -experiments ); \\n• within and b etween groups ( before and after controlled quasi -experiments ) \\nIn quasi -experiments, researchers can either partially manipulate an interventional condition to force it to \\noccur or hypothesize its effects before it naturally occurs. However, because they ca nnot exercise full control \\non conditions, quasi -experiment researchers need to account for disturbance at baseline (i.e., before an \\nintervention occurs) and control for this over the whole study period. Quasi -experiments can do this through \\ntheoretically i nformed design controls . For example, researchers can add supplementary control groups by \\nidentifying, through theory, what type of conditions would otherwise lead to the impacts that are similar to those hypothesized for the intervention of interest. Alternatively, or in conjunction with multiple control \\ngroups, researchers can also add multiple points of observations of specific proxies of interest before an \\nintervention occurs or is chosen by the units. This is usually done when theory suggests that, for  example, \\nspecific interventions can occur or a chosen by units cyclically. Examples of quasi -experiments with this kind \\nof multiple design controls are \\ncontrolled  interrupted  time series . In these quasi -experimental designs, the \\nunits of analysis are asse ssed multiple times against the main impact proxies before and after an intervention \\noccurs, and between different interventional conditions. By relying of multiple pre and post observations \\nacross different conditions, quasi -experimenters may be able to exclude different alternative hypotheses and \\nisolate the effectiveness of a specific intervention, while informing the impacts of other types of conditions. Quasi -experiment researchers can also further control for any self -selection or natural occurring bi as by means \\nof \\nstatistical controls.

However, compared to design \\ncontrols, statistical controls are less supportive of causal claims because they operate at observational level \\nand not at units of observation level.  \\nNonexperimental designs are, as their name suggests, impact studies that lack both randomization and \\nelements of design controls. A such, they do not support counterfactual inference. More precisely, these \\ndeigns do not allow researchers to exercise control over interventions and /or conditions, and therefore they \\nare commonly defined as observational studies . These studies can take several design features such as, for \\nexample, cohort studies , case -control studies  and cross -sectional studies . Compared to RCTs and quasi -\\nexperiments,  nonexperimental designs firstly identify units’ exposure to an intervention or an event of \\ninterest, and then they observe whether and when the impact occurs with or without comparators. As such, \\nnonexperimental studies have a temporal framework to assess  causality (Song and Chung, 2010) .  \\nRCTs, quasi -experiments and nonexperimental impact studies require  data that are quantifiable . Although \\nthese studies may be supported by theory and a qualitative component (e.g. Theory of Change), they always \\nassess impacts quantitatively. Data are usually collected through validated scales , objective measurements  \\n(e.g., blood samples, monitoring of physical activity, financial transactions) and also through newly designed  \\ninstruments for data collection (e.g. new technologies such as digital quantitative diaries, big data). Scales and \\nobjective measurements generate quantifiable information that undergo statistical analysis  that is complex, \\ntheoretically supported and that  can follow different types of inferences (e.g., frequentist versus Bayesian \\ninference).   \\n6.3 Social constructivism: pluralism, induction, qualitative methods  \\nSocial constructivism is generally defined as a paradigmatic umbrella of approaches to science that jointly \\nreject historical positivism’s ideas of a unique truth made of regular succession of events (Bryman, 2012) . \\nSocial constructivism recognises that social reality has no intrinsic properties , because it is mostly the \\nunderstanding of the world and the common sense that form around it via subjective experiences  (Berger and \\nLuckmann, 2011) . For this reason, social constructivists are epistemologically engaged with subjective \\ninterpretations  and meanings attribution , which are derived from personal, cultural and temporal e xperiences \\nof phenomena  (Guba and Lincoln, 1 989) . \\nSocial constructivism does not convey a unique epistemic recipe (i.e. what validates their knowledge), because made of several approaches (i.e. \\nphenomenology , hermeneutics , critical theory , and postmodern \\ndeconstructionism , among others) that acquire and justify their understanding of social constructions to \\ndifferent degrees and depth (Marques, 2017) . To mention a few of these approaches, phenomenological \\nendeavours framed within Edmund Husserl’s (1887 –1938) transcendental idealism focus on the ‘intentionality \\nof human consciousness’ (Spiegelberg, 2013, p. 107) . According to this approach, the actual content of human \\nexperiences is the only validated unit of knowledge, because res earchers remain unable to capture the mental \\nprocesses that stand behind such content production (Lynch and Peyrot, 1992) . Hermeneutical research \\nenterprises (e.g. objective and alethic, among several others) push further phenomenologists’ efforts, and \\ndedicate themselves to th e dialectic between meanings and their historical contextualisation (Mann and \\nSchweiger, 2009) . Informed by neoidealist tenets grounded in Martin Heidegger’s (1917 –1976) and Hans -\\nGeorg Gadamer’s (1900 -2002) thinking, hermeneutics aims to reconstruct the subtle meanings through the \\nsystematic study of language and its context of application (Wagenaar, 2007) .

Finally, postmodern -poststructuralist turns posit \\nquestions on the validi ty of phenomenological, hermeneutical and critical constructions; they do it by \\ndeconstructing constructions via reflexive practices (Rosenau et al. , 1992) . Drawing upon a sentiment of \\ninsecurity, scepticism and relativism following the Second World War, p ostmodernists and poststructuralists \\nrecognise the importance of meaning and experience as valid units of knowledge, but their interpretation \\nremains to be considered as the product of an elaborated process of sense making that is filtered through \\nresearch ers’ experiences (Rosenau, 2015) . \\nSocial constructivist impact studies mostly focuses on the ‘experienced’ (i.e. multiple realities) when it comes \\nto the appraisal of interventions (Clarke and Dawson, 1999) . The sense making of such experiences is usually \\ntheory -laden, such that g rand theories (e.g. broad and very abstract theoretical frameworks such as, for \\nexample, ‘integration’) are used to frame the construction of individual experiences of interventions (Barnes \\net al. , 2003) . However, in social constructivist traditions, theories are never conceived as the ultimate and true \\nexplanatory models for programmes; rather, new knowledge constantly enriches theories with new \\nconstructions (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017) . With theory being never conducive to actual knowledge \\nproduction, social constructivists rely on inductive inference and value -engaged research ; they make use of \\nthese strategies to report on proc esses of sense making across programme stakeholders (i.e. multiple realities) \\nwithout pronouncing “which set of perceptions was ‘right’ or more ‘true’ or more ‘real’” (Patton, 2014, p. 98) .  \\nIn practice, impact measurement studies that embrace social co nstructivist traditions materialize mostly as \\nqualitative studies . These studies explore, in -depth, the lived experiences of interventions’ stakeholders (e.g., \\norganizations’ managers, clients, funders, regulators). They require impact evaluators immersing  themselves \\nin the real dynamics of interventions and/or organizations. Therefore, these studies can be particularly time \\nconsuming. These studies are generally designed as single  or multiple case studies or ethnographic journeys . \\nThey employ data collecti on methods that are of discursive nature. For example: unstructured  or semi -\\nstructured (video) interviews , focus groups , observations , archival research  (Bryman, 2012)  and artifacts \\ncollection , among others. These studies require researchers to engage with textual/visual data and make sense \\nof interventions’ impacts through stakeholders’ words or artifacts. Common forms o f analysis of qualitative \\ndata that are typical of these impact studies are inductive thematic and content analysis,  which allow \\nresearchers to organize evidence of interventions’ impacts through meaningful categories and stakeholders’ voices (Vaismoradi et al. , 2013) .  \\n6.4 Critical realism : generative causation , abdu ction, mixed methods  \\nCritic al realism is a paradigm that opposes positivist and social constructionist understanding of reality and \\nreduction of causal explanation to the social acquisition of knowledge (Bhaskar, 1975) . Critical realism pursues \\nontological depth, that is to say it questions reality as existent and objective, emergent, independent from \\nhuman knowledge and never reducible to scientific statements , which a re always open to review and therefore \\nfallible (Sayer, 2000) . Critical realism sees reality as  stratified  and composed of experiences, events/outcomes \\nand deep structures that exert a real power over events/outcomes  (Bhaskar, 1975) . More precisely, critical \\nrealism states that the world is hierarchically ordered (Archer, 1995)  and made of real, actual and empirical \\ndomains, where:  \\n• the real domain  comprises structures and their causal potential or power (i.e. mechanisms) that \\ncannot  be directly observed;  \\n• the actual domain , which is a subset of the real domain, contains events that are actualised (i.e. \\ngenerated by real mechanisms) and that embody change (i.e. produce effects) that can be \\nexperienced;  ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

       " Document(page_content='36 \\n \\n• the empirical domain , which a sub set of both the real and actual domains, contains actors’ experiences \\nof the actualised events from the real domain and they can be directly observed (Mingers et al. , 2013) .  \\nFor example, the effects of inequalities can be directly observed by interviewing/survey people to appraise \\nwhether they believe they have experienced/perceived any outcomes due to avoidable factors (e.g. people \\nbelieve their asthma worsened due to lack of money to heath and de -humidify their house; people believe \\ntheir pension is too low due to long -term unemplo yment and early retirement). The actual level represents \\npeople’s right to specific inequalities being fulfilled or neglected. Such right is ultimately explainable at the real \\nlevel, where the unobservable power factors such as, for example, age and social  class are fired.  \\nCritical realism states that knowledge construction and, therefore, science should be engaging with explaining \\nthe real domain and how it relates to the actual and empirical domains (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017) . For \\nbeing engaged with explaining something that cannot be directly observed (i.e. the real domai n), critical realist \\nconcept of causality shifts from being the product of a direct observation of events, to being inferred from a \\nmore complex analysis of tendencies  (i.e. relationships) between the different domains of reality (Lawson, \\n1989) . These tendencies, in realists’ view, are never fully predictable and universal, because they are complex \\nor, according to Danermark et al.\\'s (2002, p. 21) ; they are the result of what “we experience, what actually \\nhappens, and the underlying mechanisms that produce the events in the world\". More precisely, these \\ntendencies are seen as demi -regular, and they  are the product of the interaction of certain causal powers in \\nthe real domain which Bhaskar name as ‘generative mechanisms’ (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017) .  \\nTo explain how generative mechanisms  are activated and lead to actualised events and individual experiences, \\ncritical realists rely on the concepts of analytical dualism and temporality  (Archer, 1995) . Through analytical \\ndualism, critical realism conceptualises structures  and agency  as independent entities that have differ ent but \\nrelated ontological properties (Sayer, 2000) . By structure critical realists mean institutions and roles; by agency \\nthey mean a stratification of sense of self, personal identity and social identity through time and contexts \\n(Archer, 1995; Westaway et al. , 2019) . Critical realists assume that structures operate independently from \\nagency, but they are also dependent on although not reducible to them (Archer, 2015) . This separation \\nattempts to uncover the process of how structures shape agency and, in turn, how agency contributes to either a new structuring or order of the world (i.e. morphogenesis ), or a reproduction of the preceding \\nstructures or order (i.e. morphostasis ) via, respectively, the activation of generative mechanisms or lack \\nthereof (Archer, 1995) . This process is conceived by critical realist as time dependent, whereby “(i) structure \\nnecessarily predate the action(s) of agents that transform it; and (ii) that structure necessarily postdates t hose \\nactions”  (Archer, 1995, p. 168) . \\nSupporters of critical realism see the research process as necess arily engaged with such complex dynamics \\nbetween structures and agency and, therefore, they disregard both “methodological individualism (a focus on \\nthe actors level) and holism (a focus on the collective level)”  (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017, p. 52) . Critical \\nrealists believe that “we do not uncover real struct ures by interviewing people in -depth about them” (Archer, \\n1998, p. 199) . Critical realists recognise that structures and their interplays with agency need more \\nsophisticated explanations, in which theory plays a fundamental role to: (a) make sense of and abstract from \\nhow people experience (i.e. empirical data) their structur al conditions; (b) explain how generative mechanisms \\nchange the social order and lead to impact (Bhaskar, 1998) .  \\nBy considering theory and empirical data as mutually informative and essential to advance causal explanation of how real mechanisms can change the social order, critical realist researchers operate throug h abductive \\nand retroductive inferential thinking  (Danermark et al. , 2002) . Abductive inference, formally conceptualised \\nby the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (Peirce, 1932), is understood by realist researchers as a \\nperformative way  to make sense of data that do not fall under apriori theorizing and, thus, to complement the \\nfallible nature of human knowledge production (i.e. preceding theories)  (Laurier Decoteau, 2017) .

It r econciles new abductive discovery with pre -existing knowledge to form new advanced theories \\nabout reality, so to c omplement the fallible nature of human knowledge production (i.e. in this case \\nempirically -driven knowled ge) (Bhaskar, 1998). In more accurate terms, retroduction represents a \\nconceptualising endeavour that entails researchers engaging with advancing statements about reality by identifying the conditions in which something cannot exist (Danermark et al. , 2002) . Practically, this is done by \\n“moving backward and forward among empirical data, research literature, and emergent theory” (Dey and \\nTeasdale, 2013 , p. 255).  \\nDespite widely adopted in the realm of science (Clark et al. , 2007) , critical realism generally remains “a \\nphilosophy for and not about science” and, thus, it “does not engage with methodological matters much” \\n(Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017, p. 53) . However, in recent years, critical realist stances have fruitfully informed \\nimpact measurements (McEvoy and Richards, 2006) . Critical realism has informed a specific theory -driven \\napproach to impact evaluation: re alist evaluation  (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) .  \\nRealist evaluation is a relatively recent but widely accepted approach to impa ct evaluation that has been \\nemployed by researchers and public policy evaluators (Marchal et al. , 2010; Mukumbang et al. , 2018; Pawson, \\n2016) . Realist evaluation was conceptualised by Pawson and Tilley (1997)  and it draws on Bhaskar’s critical \\nrealist critique of positivist and constructivist traditions (Bhaskar, 1975) . Realist evaluation acknowledges the \\nepistemic idea of overabundance of explanatory possibilities  in the social world, and it rejects the idea that \\nempirical endeavou r requires closed systems (i.e. historical positivist RCTs) (Pawson, 2006) . In realist \\nevaluation terms, the objects of science (i.e. interventions) are partially closed, because they operate in \\ncomplex contexts (i.e. society) and not in laboratories (Pawson, 2013) . Interventions, even when they have the \\nsame format or are part of the same family, will always respond to the context in which they operate and, thus, they will never b ehave the same way (Pawson, 2006) . The reason for this is that interventions are social \\nsystems and, thus, made of indivi duals and institutions, micro and macro processes that interact and \\ncomplement each other (Pawson and Tilley 1997).  \\nRealist evaluation appreciates that interventions or organizations are theories incarnate , that is to say they are \\ncompound and underlying assumptions or hypotheses that account for how and why activities are delivered \\nin certain ways to create impacts, for whom and under what circumstances (Pawson, 2013) . In realist \\nevaluation terms, these assumptions are not always explicit, because the ingredients of interventions are \\nmultiple and complex, sometimes hidden, and therefore in need of compound u npacking (Pawson, 2006) . The \\nduty of realist evaluation is, therefore, to make sense of such ingredients and make interventions’ underlying \\nassumptions explicit.  \\nTheories are the core of realist evaluation, and these are constructed via iterative conceptualisation, empirical \\ndata collection, analysis and conceptual refinements (Mukumbang et al. , 2018) . To guide the construction and \\ntesting of a programme theory of an intervention, realist researchers rely on clear ontological assumptions. \\nFor realist evaluators, knowledge construction is the best match researchers can do between actually -existing \\nmechanisms of society (i.e. ontological argument) and the mechanisms they propose to account for \\ninterventions’ impacts (Williams, 2018) . Realist evaluation is therefore method neutral  and can be seen as a \\npragmatic way to mix quantitative and qualitative methods and multiple study designs . Choices of methods \\nare essentially underpinned by what an intervention aims to do and how and for whom it is hypothesized to \\nwork and produce an impact in a specific context (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) .  \\nRealist evaluation explains interventions through programme theories that describe how context activates (or \\nfires or triggers) the mechanisms that lead to outcomes. This is d one by realist evaluators through the \\ncategorical formula or heuristics: Context + Mechanisms = Outcomes  (CMOs or CMO configurations) (Pawson, \\n2013) .

Rather, they stand as either prospective or retrospective hypotheses that seek to \\ndescribe the social world and its mechanisms under certain conditions and through the interactions of several \\ncomponents. These components may include an interventions’ design, objectives, resources and actors \\n(Goodridge et al. , 2015) . \\nRealist programme theories can be constructed and tested in several ways by mixing different study designs \\n(e.g. qualitative case studies, ethnographies, quasi -experiments, nonexperimental studies) and employing \\ndifferent data collection methods. Lately, some scholars have also conceptualised realist RCTs (Bonell et al. , \\n2012) . However, realist evaluations are never conducted through only quantitative approaches, because \\ngenerative mechanisms are hidden and can only be theorized. Overall, choosing from three main approaches is usually recommended to conduct realist evaluation. These approaches are recommended by existing \\nreporting standards for realist evaluation (Wong et al. , 2016) . The first approach includes: (a)  advancing \\nprogramme theories through existing literature; (b) testing programme theories through qualitative methods. \\nThe second approach to the formulation of a programme theory includes building and testing programme \\ntheories through primary research (i .e. data collection from the field). This approach mainly relies on \\nstakeholders’ assumptions about a programme, as well as on researchers’ embeddedness in the intervention \\nor their experience and professional knowledge in the field (Shearn et al. , 2017) .  The third approach to \\nprogramme theory construction, testing and refinement combines the two previous approaches. For example, \\nMukumbang et al. (2018)  have developed a programme theory of an antiretr oviral treatment adherence club \\nintervention in South Africa using three methods. First, they conducted a scoping review to identify \\nexplanatory theories (and underlying generative mechanisms) underpinning antiretroviral therapy adherence \\nclub intervention s. Second, they conducted a qualitative study to explore programme designers’ and \\nmanagers’ assumptions of the intervention and advance preliminary programme theories. Finally, through a \\nmixed -method study ( interviews plus a cohort design ), they tested their programme theories and refined \\nthem.  \\nRealist evaluations can make use of different analytical strategies to make sense of both quantitative and qualitative data collected through different types of instruments (e.g. interviews, observations, focus group s, \\nscales and objective measurements, archival research). Therefore, there is no single recipe for realist \\nevaluators.  \\n \\n \\n  ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

       " Document(page_content=\"39 \\n \\nAnnexes  \\nGRI sustainability reporting framework  \\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  is an international independent organization that helps businesses, \\ngovernments and other organizations understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability \\nissues such as climate change, human rights, corruption and many others. Its main objective is to make \\nsustainability reporting a routine for all organisations, similar to financial reporting. By using the GRI \\nGuidelines, reporting organizations disclose their most critical impacts –  either positive or negative –  on \\nenvironment, society and economy. They can generate reliable, releva nt and standardized information with \\nwhich to assess opportunities and risks, and enable more informed decision- making – both within the \\norganisations and among their stakeholders.  \\nGRI’s core product are the Sustainability Reporting Standards  which are mad e available as a free public good. \\nGRI Standards are the first and most widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting and they have been continuously developed over 20 years. The Standards are designed as an easy -to-use modular set, \\nstarting  with the universal Standards. Topic Standards are then selected, based on the organization's material \\ntopics – economic, environmental or social. This process ensures that the sustainability report provides an \\ninclusive picture of material topics, their r elated impacts, and how they are managed.  \\nIn particular, GRI defined the Reporting Principles, which can be divided into two groups:  \\n1. Principles for defining report content.  To help organizations decide what content to include in the \\nreport. This includes a n analysis of the organization's activities and impacts and the real interests and \\nexpectations of its stakeholders:  \\na. Stakeholders inclusivity , It will be necessary to identify who are the stakeholders of the \\norganization, their expectations and interests a nd how the company intends to deal with them \\n(Stakeholders Analysis);  \\nb. Sustainability contest , the information must be communicated by contextualizing the \\nsustainability context in which they occurred;  \\nc. Materiality , the report must contain information on the  aspects that: reflect the significant \\neconomic, social and environmental impacts of the organization and that influence the decisions and assessments of stakeholders (Materiality Analysis) ; \\nd. Completeness , the information presented in the report must be suf ficient to reflect the \\neconomic, social and environmental impacts and to allow stakeholders to adequately assess performance  \\n2. Principles for defining report quality.  To guide choices to ensure the quality of information in a \\nsustainability report, including  its adequate presentation:  \\na. Accuracy , the information reported must be sufficiently accurate and detailed to be able to \\nevaluate the performance of the organization ; \\nb. Balance, the report must contain both positive and negative information regarding the \\nperformance of the organization ; \\nc. Clarity , the information reported must be clear, therefore presented in an understandable \\nand accessible way to all users of the report;  \\nd. Comparability , the information reported must allow comparative analyzes to be carried out \\nwith reference to performance over time and with respect to other organizations ; \\ne. Reliability , It will have to communicate about the processes implemented to collect, compile, \\nanalyze and communicate the information reported to allow users to verify the  quality and \\nmateriality of the information ; \", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

These \\ndimensions help the enterprise t o identify the outcome it is contributing to, which stakeholders are \\nexperiencing the outcome and its importance for them, the dimension of the outcome (e.g. number of \\nstakeholders, degree of change), its attribution, the likelihood that actual impact will  be different than \\nexpected and other information.  \\nIn order to operationalize these dimensions, IMP introduces 15 impact data categories (see figure below). The objective of the impact categories is not to replace existing framework and standards but to in tegrate with \\nthem. Indeed, according to the IMP, data categories should be seen as building blocks that can be used as a guideline to create the enterprise impact management framework or as a checklist to ensure that the \\nenterprise is not missing any impor tant piece for managing impact.  \\nAccording to their own motivation (for example, comply with regulatory norm or generate positive impact), \\nthe investors’ and enterprises’ intentions can range from a broad commitment to mitigate risk or to leave e \\npositive m ark on the world, to more detailed objectives related to a specific group of people, place or outcome, \\nor to a specific social or environmental challenge.  \\nThese different intentions lead to the three types of impact defined by the IMP:  \\n• A: Act to avoid harm . This is the minimum level, the investors or the enterprises comply with regulatory \\nrequirements, or adopt a responsible behaviour  \\n• B: Benefit to stakeholders . Enterprises and investors act with specific objective of generating positive \\neffect on the world  to sustain their long -term financial performance, or they can aim to create a world \\nwhere the business try to have a positive effect on society.  \\n• C.

Signal that measurable im pact matters : this is a sort of value alignment of the investors, which express \\ntheir values. However, alone it is not very useful to progress on societal issues.  \\n2. Engage actively : engagement can vary from dialogue with companies, to creation of industry \\nstandards, to investors that use their own team or consultants to provide impact management support \\nto the investee. This strategy involves a significant proactive effort to improve impact.  \\n3. Grow new or undersupplied capital markets : investments “grow new o r undersupplied capital markets” \\nif they enable the enterprise to deliver impact that would likely not otherwise occur, or, if they \\npressure the enterprise to increase its impact generation and/or rewards it for doing so (for example, \\nchanging the price of  enterprise’s securities).  \\n4. Provide flexible capital : the investors recognize that certain types of enterprises require lower risk \\nadjusted financial return to generate specific impacts.  \\nBringing together the impact of the underlying enterprises/assets in t he portfolio (the “ABC” impact) and the \\nabove- mentioned contribution, the IMP defines the Investor’s Impact Matrix, which is compose by 12 boxes – \\nthe “Impact classes” -  that classifies the impact of a portfolio.

       " Document(page_content='49 \\n \\nSocial Return on investment  \\nSocial Return on Investment (SROI) is an outcomes -based measurement tool that helps organizations to \\nunderstand and quantify the social, environmental and economic value they are creating. The SROI is used to \\ncapture and monetize the social value created by the activities of the organization. An SROI analysis produces \\na narrative of how an organization creates and d estroys value in the course of making change in the world, \\nand a ratio that states how much social value (in £) is created for every £1 of investment (NEF, 2007).  \\nCarrying out an SROI analysis involves six stages:  \\n1. Establishing scope and identifying key sta keholders. It is important to have clear boundaries about \\nwhat your SROI analysis will cover, who will be involved in the process and how.  \\n2. Mapping outcomes. Through engaging with your stakeholders you will develop an impact map, or theory of change, which shows the relationship between inputs, outputs and outcomes.  \\n3. Evidencing outcomes and giving them a value. This stage involves finding data to show whether \\noutcomes have happened and then valuing them.  \\n4. Establishing impact. Having collected evidence on outco mes and monetised them, those aspects of \\nchange that would have happened anyway or are a result of other factors are eliminated from consideration.  \\n5. Calculating the SROI. This stage involves adding up all the benefits, subtracting any negatives and comparin g the result to the investment. This is also where the sensitivity of the results can be tested.  \\n6. Reporting, using and embedding. Easily forgotten, this vital last step involves sharing findings with stakeholders and responding to them, embedding good outcomes processes and verification of the \\nreport.  \\nSROI is based on seven principles : \\n1. Involve stakeholders:  actors who are affected by the activities carried out, they may define the social \\nvalue produced (positive or not) and identify appropriate indicat ors for measuring the social impact.  \\n2. Understand what changes: measuring outcomes to make explicit changes.  \\n3. Value the things that matter: monetize using financial proxy for measuring outcomes.  \\n4. Only include what is material: relevant and pertinent.  \\n5. Do not o ver-claim: define what would have happened anyway and what has been realized thanks to \\nthe contribution and participation of other subjects.  \\n6. Be transparent: to declare and support how stakeholders, outcomes, indicators and benchmarks were \\nidentified; the i nformation -gathering mode.  \\n7. Verify the result: to involve an independent third party.  \\nSROI offers the following potential benefits:  \\n• It can help organisations understand what social value an activity creates in a robust and rigorous way \\nand so manage its activities and relationships to maximise that value.  \\n• The process opens up a dialogue with stakeholders, helping to assess the degree to which activities \\nare meeting their needs and expectations.  \\n• SROI puts social impact into the language of ‘return on inves tment’, which is widely understood by \\ninvestors, commissioners and lenders. There is increasing interest in SROI as a way to demonstrate or measure the social value of investment, beyond the standard financial measurement.  \\n• Where it is not being used alread y, SROI may be helpful in showing potential customers (for example, \\npublic bodies or other large purchasers) that they can develop new ways to define what they want out \\nof contracts, by taking account of social and environmental impacts.  \\n• SROI can also be u sed in strategic management. The monetised indicators can help management \\nanalyse what might happen if they change their strategy, as well as allow them to evaluate the ', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'testpdfs/5.

The ratio is only meaningful within the wider \\nnarrative about the organisations. Just as an astute investor would not make a financial  decision based \\non just one number, the same practice applies to this social measurement tool. For this reason, \\ncomparisons between organisations just based on the ratio are not recommended.  \\n• SROI is an outcome, rather than a process evaluation. The dialogu e with stakeholders yields some \\ninsight into what works and what doesn’t and why, but there may be instances where a more specific process evaluation would be useful.  \\n• SROI requires a diverse skill set –  from stakeholder engagement to working with Excel spr eadsheets. \\nThis can be hard to find in one person.  \\n• SROI was developed initially for use in the third sector.

Introduction  \\nThe concepts of sustainability and impact encompass a wide variety of dimensions and perspectives. There \\nexist multiple definitions of sustainability and impact, and these have generated an extensive debate among \\nacademics and communities of practitioners.  As outlined during this course, impact can be considered as the \\nchange caused by an organization or an intervention in a social, environmental or economic outcome. Lately, \\nthe management and measurement of impact has become a mantra for those willing to c reate a positive \\nchange at a societal and/or environmental level. This is because claims about making a difference are no longer \\nenough, and evidence is required concerning the change that any agents in society has been created (Ebrahim, \\n2013). To produce this evidence, it is necessary to develop appropriate approaches and methodologies to \\nmanage and measure the generated impact.  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement is a topical and complex theme. It is of interest to a \\nvariety of actors, s uch as entrepreneurs, managers of social enterprise, non -profit organizations, lenders, \\ninvestors, managers of for -profit organizations, policy makers and academics. At this time of significant \\nchange, the debate on this theme appears particularly relevant , and the need to include the practice of \\nmonitoring and measuring impact in the organizations’ strategy is gaining momentum. This is particularly related to the attempt of public administrations to reengineer their procurement schemes according to: (a) \\nan evolving outcome- based paradigm; (b) diffusion of evidence -based practices in philanthropy as well as in \\npublic policies; (c) the interest of financial actors in measuring the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) \\ncriteria.  \\nThese elements increase the urgency for organizations to manage, quantify and make explicit their generated \\nvalue. In this context, sustainability and impact management and measurement have become strategic, since \\nthey can allow an organization to communicate its results both externa lly and internally. In the first case (i.e., \\nexternally), sustainability and impact management and measurement can contribute to organizations’ \\nstrategic positioning and/or reputation. In the second case (i.e. internally), managing and measuring sustainabi lity and impact can allow organizations to: (a) improve impact generation processes; (b) build their \\nown identity as a transformative actors able to solve societal challenges; (c) improve performances, on the \\nbasis of impact goals and targets; (d) integrate measurement approaches of investment funds and investees’ operations.  \\n2. The conc ept of (social) impact  \\nWhile social impact might be considered as a key performance -based dependent variable related to hybrid \\norganizations, the definition and conceptualization of social impact is still debated. With regard to the \\nterminology, social impact is frequently used in the existing literature as a synonymous of social value (Moss, \\nShort, Payne, & Lumpkin, 2011; Santos, 2012), social performance (Husted  & Salazar, 2006; Mair & Marti, \\n2006; Nicholls, 2008), social returns (Emerson, 2003), and social accounting (Nicholls, 2009). Despite \\nsimilarities and affinities, these terms actually refer to different concepts. Moreover, the fact that the concept of soc ial impact can be applied to various domain, such as education, health care, environmental sustainability, \\nand poverty, make its conceptualization even harder (Izzo, 2013).  \\n2.1 Social value and impact  \\nThe concept of social value  creation has been variously  defined and characterized by many authors. Schwartz \\n(1990) argued that an entrepreneurial activity creates social value when the aggregate utility of society’s \\nmembers increases after accounting for the opportunity cost of all the resources consumed during the activity.  5 \\n \\nDees (1998), focusing particularly on social entrepreneurial forms, underlined that, broadly speaking, the \\ncreation of social value implies the creation of long -lasting improvements in society. This is particularly \\nimportant for those entre preneurial forms whose primary mission is the creation of social value, namely \\ndifferent forms of social entrepreneurship and social purpose organizations.  \\nMany authors stressed that social value creation is strictly related to the capacity of entrepreneur ial activity \\nof generating value for a large variety of stakeholders. Brickson (2007) stresses that the social value can be \\nproduced by organisations in different ways based on their relationships with internal and external \\nstakeholders. She explains that value can be created for consumers and employees by meeting human needs \\n(personal esteem, belongingness, and love) and fostering human virtues (bravery, caring, and justice), linking the generation of social value to ethical values in entrepreneurial activ ity. According to Kroeger and Weber \\n(2014) the social value generated by an organization is deeply tied to the capacity of generating and improving  \\nthe well -being of a broad and various categories of stakeholders.  Finally, Lazzarini (2020) provides a nove l \\ndefinition of social value as the sum “broad social benefits to a given population (including more vulnerable \\ngroups) minus their associated provision costs” (p.19). In this sense, social value creation, can be pursued both \\nby private and public organiza tions, and it is strictly related to the capacity of entrepreneurial activity of \\ngenerating value for a large variety of stakeholders and limiting to shareholders.  From this perspective, \\nenterprises and private organizations can create social value by impr oving the well -being of individuals, \\ncommunities and society in general and sharing the value they produce with diverse types of actors (Porter \\nand Kramer, 2019).  \\nSocial value is a broad, systemic and network -based concept that relates to the societal and environmental \\nbenefits generated by an organization or an initiative.  On the contrary, when we shift to the concept of impact, \\nwe introduce a dynamic idea of change and causality and we refer to those changes which are strictly related \\nto the effect of the  organisation’s activities.  These changes can be measured and evaluated through specific \\nmethodologies.  If social value describes the wider social, economic, and environmental benefits that derive \\nfrom an organisation’s work, the impact refers to the speci fic changes taking place as a result of our activities \\nor services.   \\nTo understand the concept of impact, it may be useful to refer to the analogous concept used in natural \\nsciences. In physics the word impact is the spatial -temporal momentum in which a mo ving object clashes with \\nanother. The collision leads to the generation of both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects are detectable \\nand can be related to the two colliding objects. On the contrary, indirect effects can be undetected and are \\nrelated to the broader environment and ecosystem where the objects are placed. Similarly, in social sciences \\nthe word “impact” refers to the long -term effects generated by different types of interventions. The majority \\nof scholars and practitioners tends to clearl y distinguish between the concept of impact and those of output \\nand outcome. Particularly, impact usually concern a long -term perspective and a broad focus on macro \\ncontexts as a unit of analysis.  \\nTo understand the difference between impact, outcomes and outputs it is possible to exploit the so -called \\nimpact value chain ( Bengo et al., 2016) . The impact value chain is a theory -based framework that illustrates \\nhow an organisation’s activities lead to its ultimate desired outcome and impact. The Impact Value Chain is a \\nlinear and theory -based instrument: it is based on a pre -existing theory of Change which is articulated and \\nlinearized by the framework distinguishing the ventures activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact (see Clark \\net al., 2004).  \\nThe chain al lows to visualise the movement from outputs to impact.  Outputs include those products and \\nservices directly generated by an organization activity thanks to the transformation of inputs. Outputs are used \\nby the target group of beneficiaries, customers, or u sers. Outcomes are the changes experienced by the target \\nbeneficiaries in the short term, thanks to the use of the outputs. Finally, impacts are the changes generated 6 \\n \\nthanks to outputs and outcomes in a broader context (compared to the direct beneficiaries  of the organization \\nonly) in the longer -term.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 1 - Social Value Chain  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 2 - Example of a Social Value Chain from a Microcredit Institution  \\n \\nReferring to the value- chain, it is possible to provide a first set of definitions of impact.  This set of definitions \\nmainly draws on Social Sciences disciplines such as Economics and Econometrics and variously relies on the \\nmethodological process leading to the identification and concept of “impact”.  \\n  \\n• By impact we mean the portion of the total outcome that happened as a result of the activity of the \\nventure, above and beyond what would have happened anyway. (Clark et al., 2004)  \\n \\n• Impact [...] is the fruit of total outcomes minus external effects unconnected with the action, which \\nwould have occurred regardless of intervention. (Rossi et al., 2004)  \\n \\n7 \\n \\n• The portion of the total outcome achieved due to an organization’s activities, above and beyond what \\nwould have happened anyway. (Grieco et al., 2015)  \\n \\nThese definitions can be grouped under the broad definition:  \\n \\nImpacts are those outcomes (of interventions, policies, programs) adjusted for what would have happened \\nanyway, actions of others and unintended consequences.  \\n \\nThe concept of impact, if regard ed under this set of definitions, appears quite broad and open to a variety of \\ninterpretations. From this perspective, the concept of impact can refer to economic, social and environmental dimensions.  The integration between these three categories appears  coherent with the triple bottom line \\nperspective by Elkington (1998, 2013), that represents an accounting framework used for evaluating \\norganizational performance according to social, economic and environmental criteria.  \\nThe triple bottom line is regarde d by Vanclay (2004) both as a basis and a competing framework for social \\nimpact due to its content -related neutrality and broadness.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3 - Triple bottom line  \\n Overall, the concept of social impact departs both from that of social value given its specific reference to the \\nchanges generated by an organizations’  activity.  Moreover, the  concept of  social impact differs from that of \\n“impact”, given its non -neutral identity and its content. Thus, the concept of social impact canno t be merely \\nreduced to a definition deriving from an estimation methodology or a framework as the value -chain.  These \\nspecificities characterizing social impact open key challenges both in terms of its definition, identification and \\nmeasurement. Thus, the  next section looks more into detail to the concept of social impact and its definition.  \\n2.2 Defining social impact  \\nThe concept of social impact encompasses a wide variety of dimensions and perspectives. This has led to the \\ngeneration of multiple definitio ns and approaches to the concepts and to a wide debate on its definition.  A \\nkey set of definitions of social impact draws on the field of management, particularly referring to social \\nbusinesses and social entrepreneurship.   \\n8 \\n \\nSocial impact refers to impacts  (or effects or consequences) that are likely to be experienced by an equally \\nbroad range of social groups as a result of some course of action.  Freudenburg (1986)  \\nSocial impacts are long term outcomes or program impacts follow from the benefits accrued t hrough the \\nintermediate outcomes. (McLaughlin & Jordan, 1999)  \\nSocial impacts are the wider societal concerns that reflects and respects the complex interdependency \\nbetween business practice and society. Gentile (2002)  \\nSocial impacts are intended and unintended social consequences, both positive and negative, of planned interventions (policies, programs, plans, projects) and any social change processes invoked by those interventions. Vanclay, (2003)  \\nSocial impact is the long -term sustainable and someti mes attributable change due to a specific \\nintervention or set of interventions.  Tuan for Gate Foundation, (2008)  \\nImpact only if it increases the quantity or quality of the enterprise’s social outcomes beyond what would \\notherwise have occurred (Brest & Bo rn, 2013)  \\nSocial impact as beneficial outcomes resulting from prosocial behavior that are enjoyed by the intended \\ntargets of that behavior and/or by the broader community of individuals, organizations, and/or \\nenvironments (Stephan et al., 2016)  \\nOverall, we  can say that these definitions refer to social impact as:  \\nThe sum of effects and changes (in terms of knowledge, skills, status, living conditions, values...) often \\ngenerated in the long term on the community by the activities of an organization .  \\n2.3 The  Key features of social impact: intentionality, measurability, additionality  \\nIt is possible to identify three key characteristics of organisations generating social impact:  \\n• Intentionality  \\nThis dimension refers to the explicit willingness of the organizatio n to address a solution to a social \\nproblem and pursue the generation of a positive social impact.  \\nIn this view, the social impact pursued by the organization aims at explicitly generating positive change in the \\nbehaviors or actions of the beneficiaries di rectly involved in the intervention and in the community ( Earl, \\nCarden, and Smutylo , 2001; Niggemann and Bragger, 2011; Chiappini, 2017; Alijania and Karyotisb, 2018 ).  \\nFor example, a banking organization which pursues micro -credit and impact investing str ategies intentionally \\npursues a social impact through its core activity.  In the case of impact investment, the concept of intentionality \\ncan be translated into an explicit \"ex -ante\" declaration and in the proactive research of activities aiming at \\ncreatin g social value through capital allocation by impact investors (Bugg -Levine and Emerson, 2011 ; Alijania \\nand Karyotisb, 2018).  \\n• Measurability  \\nThis dimension refers to the organisation’s capacity and need to account for its activities in \\nquantitative and qual itative terms.  \\nSocial impact has to be measurable and measured in a quantitatively and/or qualitatively way (O’Donohoe et \\nal. 2010;  Freirich and Fulton 2009; Hebb 2013). Social Impact Measurement is a system of trust (Nicholls, 9 \\n \\n2009), not only among the s ocial entities and their beneficiaries; indeed, it is a “moral obligation” of \\norganization with a social impact to be accountable of the social outcomes they generate ( Bengo et al., 2016).  \\n• Additionality   \\nThis dimension entails that social impact generate a  positive change in fields where market \\nmechanisms fail or only partially work.  \\nAdditionality is the less cited criteria into social impact definitions.  It refers to whether the intended impact \\nwould have occurred without the investment or the interventio n (So and Staskevicius, 2015). The intervention \\nor the investment has an impact only if it increases the social and/or environmental value beyond what would \\notherwise have occurred (Brest and Born, 2013; Lazzarini, et al., 2014).  \\n2.4 The challenges of ide ntifying the generated impact  \\nThe debated definition of impact, as was briefly presented above, implies some challenges related to its \\nidentification, characterization, and measurement. Above, impact was defined as the effects and changes “adjusted for what would have happened anyway, actions of others and for unintended consequences.” \\n(EVPA, 2013, p.9). Thus, from a theoretical point of view, to identify the generated impact it is necessary to isolate the effects of an intervention from other inter -related effects or changes that would have happened \\neven without the intervention.  \\nThe challenge of impact identification is twofold. On one side it concerns understanding what the effects on \\nspecific subjects would be (for instance, effects on a country, a co mmunity, a village, an individual) when the \\nsubject has been exposed to one specific intervention. On the other side, it is also related to understanding \\nwhat would have been the outcome for a specific subject if the subject had not been exposed to that specific intervention.  The challenges to impact identification come from the fact that we cannot be fully aware of the \\nconditions of treated individuals (or communities) in the absence of the treatment.  As pointed out by Gertler et al. (2016) the problem is  that “We typically observe people, either when they have been subject to the \\nintervention, or when they have not.” (Gertler et al., 2016, p.35).  \\nTo better understand the main challenges of impact identification, it is important to understand some key \\nconcepts that are strictly related to the concept of impact:  \\n• Deadweight \\n• Attribution  \\n• Displacement  \\n• Drop off  \\n• Externality/spillover  \\n• Negative impact \\nThese concepts are presented in the sections below.  \\n2.4.1 Deadweight \\nThe first concept we introduce is deadweight. Nicholls (2009) defines deadweight as “the extent to which \\noutcomes would have happened without any interventions by the organization” (figure 4). The Scottish \\nEnterprise Economic Impact Guidance also distinguishes between two different typolog ies of deadweight:  \\n• Activity (or output/outcome) deadweight is an assessment of whether the actual activity related to \\nthe project/activity/program would have gone ahead without intervention.  10 \\n \\n• “Impact deadweight is the extent to which the resulting estima ted impacts (within the economy) from \\nan intervention would still have occurred without the activity/project/program.  \\nFigure 4 - Deadweight (Source: Scottish Enterprise Economic Impact Guidance, 2014)  \\n2.4.2 Attribution  \\nA second key concept which works in the opposite direction from deadweight is attribution. The attribution is \\nan assessment of how much of the outcome was caused by the considered intervention and not by other \\nfactors.  \\nThe concept of attribution is strict ly related to the wider concept of causality.  \\nIn the XVII the English Philosopher John Stuart Mill provided a theoretical formalization of the inductive \\napproach to “causality”, listing key necessary conditions for causality to happen as: temporal precede nce (X \\nprecedes Y), covariation (Y changes with X) and the absence of plausible alternative explanations.  \\nMackie 1974, p. 62 defined a “causa” as an “INUS condition” namely, “an insufficient but non redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient conditio n”.  \\nIn this regard, a short circuit can be an INUS condition for a house fire: … “Short circuits cause house fires is to \\nsay that the short circuit is an INUS condition for house fires. It is an insufficient part because it cannot cause \\nthe fire on its ow n (other conditions should be present). It is, nonetheless, a non- redundant part because, \\nwithout it, the rest of the conditions are not sufficient for the fire. It is just a part, and not the whole, of a \\nsufficient condition (which includes oxygen, the pr esence of inflammable material, etc.), but this whole \\nsufficient condition is not necessary, since some other cluster of conditions, for example, an arsonist with \\ngasoline, can produce the fire.” (Psillos, 2007, p. 126)  \\n“Attributing” means proving a causal  relationship between the change observed and the organization’s action, \\nprogram or policy.  Attribution appears as a key concept in impact identification and measurement.   \\nThree main problems (Nonie Impact Evaluation Guidance, 2015) must be faced to guar antee attribution in \\nimpact evaluation:  \\n• The establishment of a counterfactual, namely understanding what outcomes would have looked like in the absence of the intervention or policy or program (Ferraro, 2009).  \\n• The elimination of «selection effect”:  if the  beneficiaries of an intervention are not \\n“randomly” selected the inherent characteristics of the group selected for the treatment \\nmay bias the estimation of the impact of a treatment/intervention/program, potentially \\n11 \\n \\nleading to attributing to the treatmen t the effects which on the contrary are due to inherent \\ncharacteristics of the group.  \\n• A solution for the problem of unobservable characteristics of the groups which may be \\nconfused with the effects of the treatment.  \\nA solution to the problem of attributio n is the Counterfactual Analysis  \\nThe counterfactual analysis is an approach to impact evaluation which involves the comparison of the \\noutcomes on the beneficiaries of a policy, a program, an intervention (the “treatment group”) with those of a \\ngroup simila r in all respects to the treatment group (the “comparison/control group”). In this analytical \\napproach the only difference existing between the two groups is that the control group has not been exposed \\nto the intervention.  \\n• An open issue concerns how to sel ect the control group. n the “differences in differences” design \\n(another quasi -experimental design) two different groups are compared before and after the \\ntreatment. The effect of the treatment on the outcome of interest is obtained by comparing the \\navera ge change over time in the outcome variable for the treatment group, compared to the average \\nchange over time for the control group.  This design requires to assume “a parallel trend assumption” \\nbetween the two groups.  The choice of this design requires to  reasonably assume that, in the absence \\nof the treatment, the two groups would have followed parallel trends on the outcome variable.  \\nAccording to the typology of research design adopted, the control group can be created in different ways \\n(Table 1):  \\nIn pur ely experimental designs, as randomized controlled trial, the selection between treatment and control \\ngroups takes place on random basis.  \\n• In “regression discontinuity designs” (a quasi - experimental design1) the selection of treatment and \\ncontrol groups is based on a threshold established on a continuous assignment variable which must \\nnot be correlated with the treatment. Through the comparison of observations lying on either side of the threshold it is poss ible to estimate the average treatment effect . \\n• In the “differences in differences” design (another quasi -experimental design) two different groups \\nare compared before and after the treatment. The effect of the treatment on the outcome of interest \\nis obtain ed by comparing the average change over time in the outcome variable for the treatment \\ngroup, compared to the average change over time for the control group.  This design requires to \\nassume “a parallel trend assumption” between the two groups.  The choice o f this design requires to \\nreasonably assume that, in the absence of the treatment, the two groups would have followed parallel trends on the outcome variable.  \\n \\n                                                           \\n1 The actual difference between experimental and quasi -experimental design lies in the random or not random \\nassignment of units to the treatment group.  12 \\n \\n \\nTable 1: Typology of research design for counterfactual analysis and impact identification  \\nSection 6 of this document will give details on these issues.    \\n2.4.3 Displacement  \\nThe concept of displacement involves an assessment of how much of one outcome has displaced other \\noutcomes. Displacement can be used to assess the ef fects of philanthropic or impact investing money.  There \\nis an effect of displacement when donors’ or investors’ money crowd out other money that would have \\ndelivered the same service (often, though not always, without philanthropic/impact investing dollar s) (Karlan \\net al., 2016). A classic example is a healthcare clinic funded by donors: that clinic may simply be replacing an \\nexisting clinic, perhaps private, that served roughly the same population with roughly the same quality of \\nservices. The “impact” of  those donor dollars is roughly zero (those patients would have gotten the same \\nquality of care anyway).  \\nDisplacement can be negative or positive. Negative displacement reduces the impact of the donor dollars, as \\nthe outcome would have happened anyway. Good displacement increases the impact of the donor/investors’ \\ndollars; by displacing programs that are havi ng little impact or doing harm. (Impact Matters, 2015). \\nDisplacement can be estimated through rigorous studies, but these studies are very seldom done on any social sector programs anywhere in the world.  \\nIn the absence of rigorous data, it is possible to make qualitative estimations through a “best guess” on a \\nparticular’s organization’s displacement, basing that guess on anecdotal information, non -counterfactual \\nsecondary data from studies, and general knowledge. Displacement (and externalities below) is often relatively apparent when it appears significant enough to be of concern. (Impact Matters, 2015). It can also be roughly \\nestimated ex post with a survey approach with specific questions designed in the form: “what would you have done if you had not ta ken this program”.  \\n2.4.4 Drop off  \\nWith the drop- off concept we describe the deterioration of an outcome over time. The concept relates to the \\nfact that over time the importance of the impact of a treatment decreases.  \\nThe organization should be aware of which beneficiaries are dropping off and if there are commonalities \\namong them. (EVPA,2013). The creation of «panel dataset», can be useful to monitor the potential impact \\ndrop off.  \\n4.5 Negative impact  \\nThe term «Negative impact» is an uncommon terminology especially if we adopt the first definition approach \\nto impact which is expressed in section 4.1 (effects and changes (in terms of knowledge, skills, status, living \\nconditions, values ...) generated in the long term on the community by the activities of an  organization.)  \\n13 \\n \\nFrom a more methodological point of view, negative impact can be regarded as significant, proved and reverse \\neffect of an activity/program/policy with regard to pre -set objectives.  Consequently, the negative impact is a \\ndifferent concept from that of «nonresult» i.e. absence or non- significant effects of the intervention.  \\nGertler et al. 2016, in the World Bank Impact Evaluation Guide, provide practical indications for organizations \\nwhich have to cope with negative impact:  \\n “Understanding how the intervention was implemented is particularly crucial when evaluation results show a \\nlimited or negative impact. Nonresults or negative results are no reason to punish program or evaluation \\nmanagers. Rather, they provide an opportunity for program and evaluation managers to explain clearly what \\ndid not work as intended; that, in itself, can lead to large policy gains and should be rewarded.” (Gertler et al., \\n2016, p.218)  \\n2.4.6 Spillovers & Externalities  \\nA key challenge in the definition of social im pact and its measurement is that of distinguishing the actual \\n(social) impact of an intervention, an investment or a program from the externalities or spillovers it generates.  \\nThe concept of attribution allows to distinguish the concept of impact from tha t of externality/spillover.  The \\nconcepts of externality or spillover derive from the framework of neoclassical Economics.  \\nFrom a microeconomic market transaction perspective an “externality” is defined by Hutchinson (2016) as \\n“The effect of a market excha nge on a third party who is outside or “external” to the exchange. Because \\nexternalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved, they are sometimes called  \\nspillovers or externalities . Externalities can be negative or p ositive.”   \\nThe economist Daron Acemoglu defines spillovers as “as indirect effects of a treatment”. Externalities “ can \\nbias the direct effect, and/or they can be of economic interest themselves”  (Acemoglu et al ., 2017, p.13).  \\nThe difference between externality and impact creates important issues for impact evaluation, since the effect \\nof externalities is sometimes unknown or unpredictable ex -ante. Moreover, externalities can be both positive \\nand negative, leading to gains or losses in the efficacy and ef ficiency of an intervention (Bernheim and \\nWhinston,2001).  To measure externalities in practice, economists exploit a wide variety of different \\nmethodologies.  \\nOn one side quantitative methodologies rely on monetization. Through monetization techniques it i s possible \\nto quantify the value of an externality, estimating the cost of the damages product by the externality or the \\nsavings that the externality allows to obtain. Another potential and “reverse method” consists in the \\nmonetization of the cost required  to control the externality itself.  Moreover, other quantitative methods to \\nestimate externalities rely on econometric counterfactual analysis.  \\nIdentifying and accounting for Spillovers: two lessons from Development Economics  \\nKremer and Miguel (2004, 2007) provide a counterfactual impact evaluation of a deworming program \\nimplemented in the Primary Schools of Kenya. In the program 30.000 students were treated with deworming \\npills. The output of the intervention was made up by the number of delivered pills, the outcome by the \\ninfections reduction and the impact of the intervention by health and nutrition conditions improvement and \\neducational outcome. The experiment proved a positive effect on treated children.  \\nHowever, the evalu ation was not complete due to the presence of large externalities in health and in \\neducation. Actually, the fact that children received the pill and worm infections were reduced had fundamental \\neffects also over non treated children both attending the same  school of treated children both attending \\ndifferent schools closed to the treated ones.  14 \\n \\nThe randomization of treatment intervention at school level allowed to catch important externalities across \\nschool and within schools. In this way the economists were  able to estimate the overall impact of the program. \\nCross school externalities were measured analyzing outcomes and impacts and exploiting exogenous variation in the closeness of control schools to treatment schools. On the contrary, within school externa lities have been \\nmeasured comparing outcomes and impacts on individuals displaying low or high compliance to the treatment.  \\nAlso Janseens (2004) offers an evaluation of a women empowerment program named “Mahikya Samakya”, \\nset in rural India. The impact evaluation study is provided with an analysis and an estimation of spillovers. In \\nthis case, in order to measure treatment spillovers, the authors implemented the survey both in treatment \\nand in control villages. Running the survey including also program non  participants, living in villages where the \\nprogram is effective appears as a fruitful way to identify and catch spillovers.  \\nSpillovers or Strategic Interactions?  \\nGoing beyond the identification of impact and of externalities/spillovers, Acemoglu et al., 2 017 distinguish \\nbetween the impact (direct effect) of a treatment, the pure spillover (externality) and the strategic interaction.  \\nAccording to Acemoglu et al. (2017), strategic interaction takes place when there are interactions between the direct effect s of a treatment (the impact) and the spillover effects. In the strategic interaction, the extent \\nof the spillover depends on the treatment status of a specific individual. Strategic interactions play a key role \\nin social innovation and social impact proce sses.  \\nSpillovers as unintended consequences  \\nA further perspective on externalities or spillovers, analyses these elements as the effects that come about as \\na result of an activity but that are not part of the desired and pre -set objectives.  In spite of no t having any \\ntheoretical formalization in academic literature, this approach is shared, as example, by the European Venture \\nPhilantrophy Association, which states that “By defining outcomes in line with objectives implies that an \\norganisation focuses on th e intended consequences of its interventions.” (EVPA, 2013, p.42).  \\nNonetheless, in spite of this focus, every intervention, policy, program displays a series of unintended \\nconsequences. According to the EVPA point of view, a part of the unintended conseque nces may be foreseen \\nby the organization because, although the results of the activities on a particular community or group are not \\nexplicitly intended, they appear as a clear result of the organization’s activities and hence they should be \\nfactored into the defined outcomes and assigned indicators.  \\nOther effects, which coincide with the spillover concept, may only manifest themselves once the activities of \\nthe organization are underway: for example, the beneficiaries of a treatment may respond to it in an \\nunexpected way, or the effects may reach more peripheral stakeholders than the forecasted direct \\nbeneficiaries. To pick up these unintended consequences, an organization should review its activities periodically as part of the monitoring and evaluation pro cess. In this perspective the absence of an explicit and \\nforecastable intention may be regarded as the distinguishing element between impact and externalities. \\nImpact to be identified ought to be distinguished from its unintended consequences.\\n  \\n3. Context and sustainability and impact management and measurement \\ndrivers  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement have become a topical theme. For this reason, it is \\ncrucial to consider the context in which and the reasons why sustainability and impact management and \\nmeasurement play a role in society. The next sections of this chapter will outline: (1) how social and \\nenvironmental challenges affects measurement systems; (2) how the issues of impact measurement, and 15 \\n \\nmore generally of an impact economy, are closely linked to regulatory aspects; (3) how companies and impact \\nfinance influence and are influenced by sustainable and impact management and measurement processes.  \\n3.1 Social and environmental challenges  \\nThe world is facing new challenges. These ar e generated by emerging social, economic, environmental and \\npolitical transformations which, in the last two years, have been exacerbated by the Covid -19 pandemic. Since \\nthe beginning of the century, our society has been characterized by new demographic tr ends such as an ageing \\npopulation, new forms of households, urbanizations and migration, among others. The sustainability of our \\nsociety (and of our planet at large) is also affected by climate change, which is causing economic losses and \\ngrowing demand fo r energy, food and water. These transformations are challenging existing welfare systems \\nand calling for new welfare and caring models that are able to tackle widening social exclusion and inequalities.  \\nTo address these challenges, different global initiatives to achieve sustainable development have been designed and implemented. Among the main recent ones, the most well recognised framework to \\ncommunicate objectives and results connected to economic, soc ial and environmental sustainability is the \\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  \\n \\nFigure 1 SDGs  \\nSDGs, which are framed within a wide program that encompasses 169 specifi c targets and a set off more than \\n240 indicators, have become the cornerstone for the development of many national and local strategies due to their universality, mutual interconnection and transformative power. The SDGs framework has also inspired differe nt methods and approaches to sustainability and impact measurement, all of which intended as a means \\nto demonstrate and monitor the achievement of specific development targets.  \\n3.2 Regulation  pressure  \\nIn recent years, there has been a law development, especially at European level, which aims to set out a regulatory framework for how market players - including investors and entrepreneurs -  shall operate in order \\nto be impactful and ESG compliant.  \\nBefore mentioning some of these measures, it is worth looking  briefly at the policy framework that has driven \\nsuch development. Europe’s orientation towards an impact economy has its roots in the Treaty on European Union and it has been reinforced through the European Pillar of Social Rights, according to which “pur suant \\nto Article 3 of the Treaty, the aims of the European Union are inter alia to promote the well -being of its peoples \\nand to work for the sustainable development of Europe based on a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment an d social progress. The Union shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, \\n16 \\n \\npromote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and \\nprotection of the rights of the child”. Subsequently, there has been a cascade of policy interventions, among \\nwhich the most relevant are the “European Commission Innovative Union Initiative & Social investment \\nPackage” (2010), the “Social Business Initiative -  SBI” (2011), the “EU Programme for Employment and Social \\nInnovati on - EaSI” (2013) , the “European Fund for Strategic Investments -  EFSI” (2014), also known as the \\nJuncker Plan, the “Social Impact Accelerator -  SIA” (2015), and, in more recent times, the “Action Plan on \\nFinancing Sustainable Growth” (2018) , the “Europea n Green Deal”  (2019) , the EU Taxonomy (2020), the Social \\nTaxonomy (2021) and the European Social Economy Action Plan ( 2021 ). All these initiatives have stimulated \\nthe market to adopt social innovation solutions as a resource for growth and jobs, mobilisin g private investors \\nas well as social entrepreneurs, and creating the basis for a favourable legal environment.  \\nFollowing such policy development, the European Union has defined common rules and a regulatory perimeter \\nto drive the ESG and an impact econom y market, covering both the financial and corporate sector through, \\nfor instance, benchmarks, standards and obligations of corporate due diligence, disclosure and reporting.  For \\nexample, EU Reg. 346/2013 “on European social entrepreneurship funds” has est ablished the so -called \\n“EuSEF” funds, dedicated to social entrepreneurship, for the promotion of investments in companies that has \\n“the achievement of measurable, positive social impacts as its primary objective in accordance with its articles \\nof associati on, statutes or any other rules or instruments of incorporation”. This intervention sets out the \\nobligation for fund managers to adopt procedures to define the extent to which target companies achieve the expected (positive) social impact and to communicat e to their investors the method used to measure such \\noutcomes. More recently, EU Reg. 2088/2019 “on sustainability -related disclosures in the financial services \\nsector” (so called \"SFDR Regulation\") has introduced specific disclosure requirements with rega rds to the \\nsustainability risks of financial products; the SFDR was then complemented by EU Reg. 852/2020 which \\nestablishes “a framework to facilitate sustainable investment” (the so -called \"Taxonomy Regulation\").   \\nIt is interesting to note that these rec ent legislative developments intervene and complement the non -\\nfinancial reporting pursuant to Directive 2013/34/EU, for example by including in the non -financial statement \\nthe extent to which companies\\' activities are associated with environmentally sustai nable economic activities.  \\nAt the same time, even if the combined two regulations are currently focused on environmental aspects, their \\nscope is expected to be further extended by including \"social\" objectives. Furthermore, with specific reference \\nto pens ion funds, Directive (EU) 2016/2341 specifically designed for pension funds includes considerations “on \\nenvironmental, social and governance factors related to investment assets in investment decisions”.  \\nFinally, it is essential to consider the legal fram ework also in its formation, namely looking ahead and \\nconsidering the ongoing legal initiatives that are expected to materialize as effective and binding legislative acts. This regulatory path has already been marked by the: (i) recent European Parliament resolution with \\nrecommendations to the European Commission on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability (with \\nreference to ESG, value chain and Business Human Rights due diligence); (ii) proposal for a European legal act \\non \"sustainable governan ce\" that incorporates sustainability issues in companies, for example by redefining \\nfiduciary duties of directors and the concept of corporate “social interest”.  \\nFrom the above, it is evident that the European legislator is focusing on impact assessment a nd measurement \\nthrough disclosure obligations with the objective of leading market actors towards a sustainable transition. Essentially, the legal system discussed so far aims to provide clarity and common rules for such transition and, \\nin turn, prevent im pact and green washing, which are those practices that threaten the integrity of the \\nsustainability framework and expose market operators to reputational and legal risks.  \\nThis regulatory evolution is also widening the access of consumers, and stakeholders  in general, to remedies. \\nMore precisely, such regulatory changes at European level are providing stakeholders with the legal capacity \\nof invoking liability of companies and funds for not fulfilling sustainability obligations. For example, human \\nrights, ad equate responses to the climate crisis or avoidance of green and impact washing business practices.  17 \\n \\nIt is evident that companies and financial actors should adapt to the new regulatory frameworks, possibly \\nanticipating any regulatory trends. Adopting adequate legal safeguards should not exclusively result into a \\nmere compliance activity, but also into a full integration of impact and ESG measurement into the core \\nbusiness. This would allow companies to avoid legal and reputational risks and at the same time  - as a \\nconsequence and with effects on a strategic level -  ensure an advantage over competitors, also in terms of \\nattracting investments and anticipating market trends.  \\n3.3 New hybrid actors and finance for impact  \\nThe emergence of new social needs, pressing societal and environmental  challenges and the evolution of new \\neconomic paradigms, prompted the development of new organizational forms that aim to address new global social, political, and economic trends. These  organizations adopt innovative  business models by blending \\nsocial, environmental  and economic purposes and generating impact as part of their core activities. These \\norganizations, known as “hybrid organizations”, aim to fill the gap between purely philanthropic organizations \\n(e.g., traditional third sector organizations and charities) and  purely commercial ventures.  Hybrid \\norganisations are characterized by a varied stakeholder profile; their governance structure includes multiple \\nstakeholders, and their a ctivities have an effect on a broad range of different actors (e.g. beneficiaries, \\ncustomers, funders and employees). All these stakeholders often have different needs and \\nexpectations  (Dohrmann et al., 2015;\\u202fHockerts, 2015; Santos et al., 2015). Moreover,  hybrid organizations \\nhave to balance between the achievement of both social and environmental mission and profit generation. Thus, the question is how hybrid organizations can integrate, manage and prove their hybridity.  \\n \\nFigure 2 Hybrid organisations spectrum  \\nThe global financial crisis in 2007 has also led to re -thinking financial innovation processes (Khraisha  and Artur, \\n2018) and pursuing innovative financing (Sandor et al, 2009). Since 2007, considerable efforts have been made to reform the financial system and make it more innovative, democratic and inclusive (Kim and Hann, 2019), \\nby also rediscovering the importance of the ESG dimensions for the economic and financial system (Chapra, 2014). Over the years, the market has sta rted to realize how shareholder wealth maximization is no longer a \\nvalid guide for the creation of sustainable wealth (Fatemi  and Fooladi, 2013). This has led a paradigm shift that \\nstirred the  development  of various model of sustainable finance.  Moreover, traditional rating players have \\nentered the market, with some recent important operations such as Moody’s acquisition of a majority stake in Vigeo Eiris as well as S&P Global’s purchase of the ESG business of RobecoSAM. Even if this market expansion is con tributing to let the ESG ratings and rankings entering the mainstream finance, some concerns on data \\nquality and integration with traditional financial reporting and research are still concerning main players. Company level ESG ratings from different ratin g agencies show low correlations due to differences in their \\nmethodologies. In this context, the ESG criteria are differently combined with financial expectations of the \\ninvestors. For example, the concept of impact finance refers to the deployment of fina ncial resources primarily \\nfor generating impact on the ESG components, as well as in some cases, a financial  return.  Conversely, ESG \\ncomponents can be measured just to mitigate the risks of unexpected events that may affect the financial performance of the  investments. Impact investors aim to allocate their financial resources to investments that \\n18 \\n \\ncombine two dimensions and potentially conflicting logics: financial performances and impacts on the ESG \\ncriteria. The problem is, therefore, how to combine confli cting logics in the same entity, and thus how to make \\nsure impact investors can measure and demonstrate the impact generated by their investments while \\nachieving expected financial performances.  \\n \\nFigure 3 - Impact finance spectrum  \\n4. Approaches, methods and metrics evolution  \\nAs detailed above, the evolution of sustainability and impact management and measurement is strictly related \\nto the social and environmental challenges and the different ways impact organisations try to address  them. \\nWe argue that the best approaches to measure and manage impact are the ones that overcome the risk of impact washing. This type of phenomenon is today challenged by both organizations’ stakeholders (more and more sensitive to environmental and socia l issues) and new laws and regulations that try to limit these kinds \\nof distortion and by driving companies towards an increased sustainability. In sum, organizations are \\nincreasingly required to show sound evidence of the impacts they can create and how t hese impacts are \\nevidenced.  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement practices can have implications for organizations in terms of communication, identity and transaction . \\nCommunication  \\nAmong the multiple drivers that can lead an organization to develop or adopt an approach to measure impact, \\nthe need of communication, or reporting, is certainly one of the most widespread. The chosen measurement \\napproach can lead to different kind of communication. Investment funds, for example, manage the \\nmeas urement of impacts of their investees to properly communicate with shareholders or to comply with \\nmandatory institutional regulations. Organizations can have different communication objectives. They can \\nassess their social, environmental and economic perfo rmances in order to be transparent with their \\nstakeholders. In this case, the impact measurement practice is used with an informative scope. Alternatively, \\norganizations may want to communicate externally their strategic positioning with respect to sustain able or \\nimpact objectives and align internally the organizational values to these goals. Lastly, impact measurement \\n19 \\n \\ncan be also used to communicate the impact strategies internally, to the staff and other internal stakeholders, \\nto improve impact management  processes and grow in terms of impact generation.  \\nIdentity  \\nSustainability and impact management and measurement practices can contribute to build an organization’s \\nidentity. Measurement can enhance the identity of organizations, investors or funds, in te rms of their \\npropensity for integrating sustainability and impact in their business proposition. Thus, sustainability and \\nimpact management and measurement can have different results. Organizations that focus on demonstrating \\ntheir social and commercial pe rformances can use measurement tools to build on their own image as \\nresponsible entities to their stakeholders. Moving from a purely external approach to an internally driven \\nmanagerial perspective on assessing social and environmental effectiveness, the i mage concept can evolve \\ninto identity. An organization that integrates impact measurement practices into its strategy and decision -\\nmaking processes can concretely become a responsible entity and build its identity in this direction. Moreover, \\nif an organization integrates impact measurement tools into its operational processes, it could be able to \\nstrengthen its identity and become a transformative actor able to solve societal challenges.  \\nTransaction  \\n“Principal -agent” relationship between two or more stake holders (investors and investees, social enterprises \\nand their clients and beneficiaries) can be affected by sustainability and impact management and \\nmeasurement practices in terms of: managing the level of information asymmetry, the bargaining power, the \\nrisks of moral hazard and mission drift. In this case, the negotiations among stakeholders and the final \\narrangement depends on the bargaining power of different parties. This process may lead to mission -drift: for \\nexample, social enterprises may have to d ivert from their social -oriented purposes to meet the expectations \\nof business -related stakeholders. In the finance context, the risk of mission drift is higher when investors \\nrequire their investees to perform an ex -post measurement of the impacts criteri a (e.g., ESG criteria). On the \\ncontrary, mission -drift is less likely when investors and investees define ex -ante their impact goals and impact \\ncriteria (e.g., ESG) and coherently integrate them into contractual agreements and investment performance \\nmonito ring systems. Lastly, this type of relationships negotiated through impact management and \\nmeasurement may also generate a new set of impact measurement practices, which are relational and non -\\ntransactional in nature and entail an evolving and ongoing mutua l learning process (Chen and Harrison, 2020). \\nThis is the case when the organizations actively engage with their stakeholders to improve their benefits, on \\nthe basis of impact goals and scalable targets.  \\nWe propose here a taxonomy of existing approaches to  sustainability and impact management and \\nmeasurement as outlined in the figure below.  20 \\n \\n \\nFigure 4 Taxonomy  \\n4.1 Proving sustainability  \\nProving sustainability approaches to impact management and measurement are used by organizations to be \\ncompliant with regulatory frameworks and communicate the results of their activities to mainly external \\nstakeholders. Proving sustainability practices de monstrate, in an informative way, the overall performances of \\nan organization and enable its legitimacy to external audiences. This model, which is conceptually related to \\nnon-financial disclosure practices, aims at better defining an organization’s image as a responsible entity. For \\nexample, in the finance world, this practice is used to manage negotiations between investors and investees, \\nin that the investor requires the investee to report ex -post how ESG risks of their businesses are managed. In \\nthis se nse, proving sustainability practices are mainly underpinned by a logic of compliance and are usually \\ntranslated by organizations into reporting non -financial performances. Accordingly, the measurement of \\nimpact takes a narrative shape in organizations’ re porting practices. These practices disclose information \\nmostly at an output level, thus avoiding picturing a trajectory of outcomes and impact directly attributed to \\norganizations’ activities.  \\nThe main instrument through which organizations communicate their socially responsible behaviour to \\ndifferent stakeholders is the Sustainability Report, that must be comprehensive and representative of the relevant issues affecting a company and its sector, as well as functional to the informative needs of the \\ndiffer ent stakeholders.  Sustainability Reports are produced on a voluntary basis, except for large companies \\nor groups of companies. Another option is to develop an Integrated Report, in which companies’ financial \\nstatements and non -financial information (enviro nmental, social and governance issues) are merged into a \\ndescriptive sustainability report.  To produce a report, organizations usually adopt available standards that \\nprovide a benchmarking tool for communicating with external stakeholders in an open, balan ced and \\nconsistent manner. This is done by organizations to strengthen or maintain credibility and provide assurance \\nof practices through independent certification.  \\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a non -financial disclosure methodology that ensur es organizations’ \\naccountability to internal and external stakeholders in terms of environmental, social and governance \\nperformances. The GRI is an approach adopted mostly by listed companies and is used as a tool to adhere to regulatory compliance mechani sms. It supports organizations with disclosing information on how business \\nmodels operate in terms of specific social and environmental outputs. Similar to financial reporting practices, \\nthe GRI embraces an ex -post valuation approach, mostly due to complia nce issues.   \\nThe ESG approach is another important model which can broadly fall within Proving sustainability approaches \\nto measuring and reporting the sustainability and impact of an organization. ESG frameworks guide \\n21 \\n \\norganizations through environmental, social and governance factors against which measuring the impacts of \\ntheir activities. While non -financial organizations broadly adopt ESG frameworks as non -financial disclosure \\npractice, financial institutions may instead make use of ESG frameworks in dif ferent and more complex ways. \\nMore precisely, ESG frameworks have witnessed important advances in the financial sector, in that financial \\ninstitutions have progressively adapted ESG frameworks to different and more robust approaches to impact \\nmeasurement a nd management. The GRI standards and the ESG approach are briefly presented in Annex 1&2.  \\nProving sustainability models have implication in terms of communication, identity and transaction as outlined \\nin the following table:  \\nCommunication  An organizatio n communicates (both internally and externally) its results only with an \\ninformative scope  \\nIdentity  Measurement aims to build an organization\\'s image as a responsible entity  \\nTransaction  Investors require investees to perform ex -post measurement of results  \\nTable 2 - Proving sustainability implications  \\n4.2 Aligning with societal grand challenges  \\nThis category includes approaches entailing more robust systems of impact management than those of Proving \\nSustainability. In this type of models, practices interpret sustainability from a \"nice to have\" to a \"must have”. In this context, measurement of impact emerges not only from a narrative perspective, but also from the \\nidentification and disclosure of a set of overarching social and environmental challenges that need to be \\naddressed. In this context, the alignment with societal grand challenges has been regarded by scholars as a \\nmethod of disclosure that helps boost corporate sustainability credibility because it ensures a link be tween \\nthe outputs and impacts (Ferraro et al. 2015). In this type of methodologies, the focus is on stimulating \\ncompanies to align the assessment of their internal management and decision -making practices with their \\ncontributions to the most urgent social and environmental needs. Organizations that adopt these \\nmethodologies coherently picture their interests and strategies with broader objectives. They also provide a \\ndisclosure mechanism that is characterized by understanding, managing and communicating the  social and \\nenvironmental objectives which align with their organizational practices and function.   \\nThese approaches enable organizations to communicate, externally, their strategic positioning with respect to \\nsustainable or impact objectives while aligning, internally, their organizational values to these goals. Moving \\nfrom a purely external legitimacy approach of narrating social impact, these methodologies stimulate an \\ninternally driven managerial perspective on assessing social effectiveness. In this context, there is a shift from \\ncommunicating ethical and responsible behaviour for a matter of reputation to a proper concept of organizational identity that is oriented towards sustainable development. Through these types of \\nmethodologies, organizations integrate the vision of contributing to societal grand challenges in their \\nstrategies and decision -maki ng processes. For example, compared to Proving sustainability processes, A ligning \\nwith societal grand challenges approaches to measuring and managing impact require organizations to \\nnegotiate ex -ante common goals and targets that should be aligned to the p erformance monitored and \\nmeasured ex post.   \\nThe impact management and measurement standards which fall within aligning to societal gran challenges \\nmethodologies are tools that support organizations with converging towards the SDGs. The SDGs can help a \\ncomp any or a whole sector align their social and environmental outputs with one or more SDGs. The SDG \\nImpact Standards (see annex 3 for detailed information) are a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of social \\nand environmental outputs that can be applied by most organizations to identify their specific contributions \\nto one or more SDGs. They provide actionable guidance for embedding social and environmental objectives \\ninto an organization’s strategy and influencing decision -making and risk management proc esses. As 22 \\n \\nanticipated, Aligning with societal grand challenges models have implication in terms of communication, \\nidentity and transaction as outlined in the following table:  \\nCommunication  Organisations  communicate: externally its strategic positioning w ith respect to the \\nsustainable or impact objectives; internally to align the organisational values to the \\nsustainable or impact objectives  \\nIdentity  Measurement aims to build the organization’s identity as a responsible entity  \\nTransaction  Investor and investee define ex -ante impact goals and targets coherent with their strategies \\nand integrate them into  both  agreement and investment performance monitoring system  \\nTable 3 - Aligning with societal grand challenges implications  \\n4.3 Generating impact  \\nGenerating impact methodologies support organizations with defining an impact strategy and the pathways for impact generation. According to these approaches, impact is the change in a social, environmental or \\neconomic outcome caused by an  organization and it is characterized by three key features: intentionality, \\nmeasurability and additionality. Intentionality  refers to the explicit willingness of an organization to address a \\nsolution to a social problem and pursue the generation of a posi tive social impact. Measurability  refers to the \\norganization’s capacity and need to account for its social -oriented activities in quantitative and qualitative \\nterms. Additionality  entails that social impact generates a positive change in fields where marke t mechanisms \\nfail or only partially work. When organizations attempt to pursue these three features, their communication \\nstrategies are driven by impact generation aims. This implies that organizations define a robust sustainability and impact management a nd measurement process of analysis, monitoring, measurement and management \\nof the short, medium and long term effects of their activities on the community in relation to the identified \\nobjectives. For example, in the finance sector, this process supports i nvestees and investors with: (i) agreeing \\non and aligning internal practices with ex -ante defined overarching societal goals; (ii) translating such goals \\ninto impact action to better inform decisions and drive activity and investment capital to where it is  needed.  \\nAccording to Generating impact methodologies, the impact management and measurement of an organization’s activities is built around communicating impact strategies internally, to the staff and other \\ninternal stakeholders, with the aim of improving  impact management processes and internalizing a culture of \\nimpact generation. Furthermore, organizations that adopt methodologies that integrate impact measurement \\ntools into their operational processes are also able to strengthen their identity of transf ormative actors \\npotentially able to solve societal challenges. Oftentimes, this typology of approaches emerges from the \\nnegotiation process between organizational stakeholders. This process, which is relational and non -\\ntransactional in nature and based on mutual learning, can lead to choosing impact measurement practices \\nthat best fit the interests of all the actors involved in an organization (Chen and Harrison, 2020).  \\nThe standards for Impact generating approaches are those in which outputs, outcomes and impact are all \\nlinked by an ex -ante defined Theory of Change. Theory of Change is the logic model that supports organizations \\nwith identifying what environmental and social impact can be generated or achieved by their specific activities \\n(Ebrahim and Rang an 2014). It implies the creation of a dashboard of KPIs that derive from the activities of an \\norganization and are strictly connected to overarching impact objectives. A Theory of Change is defined as the causal connection between activities and results ( in the form of output, outcome and impact measures). Such \\nmeasures will then be translated into a range of qualitative and quantitative indicators, depending on the scope and depth of analysis.  Theory of Change should integrate intentionality, measurabili ty and additionality \\nin organizations’ logic models. This means that the activities of an organization should intentionally aim at \\ncertain measurable performances and impacts, possibly in contexts where they are needed the most \\n(additionality).  Examples of  generating impact approaches are: Impact Management Project, Impact Weighted 23 \\n \\nAccounts and Social Return on Investment (SROI), all of which are described in annexes 4, 5, 6.  As anticipated, \\nGenerating impact models have implication in terms of communicatio n, identity and transaction as outlined \\nin the following table:  \\nCommunication  An organization communicates its impact results externally with a strategic positioning \\npurpose and internally to improve the impact management and generation processes  \\nIdentity  Measurement aims to build an organization’s identity as a transformative actor in solving \\nsocietal challenges  \\nTransaction  On the top of the previous activities, the investor actively engages with the investees to \\nimprove their performance, base d on the impact goals and targets, and to fully integrate the \\nmeasurement infrastructure into the operations of the investees as a learning process.  \\nTable 4 - Generating impact implications \\n4.4 Sustainability and impact management and measurement approaches and standards  \\nAs seen throughout this chapter, managing and evaluating impact is crucial to and relevant for many sectors \\nand stakeholders. However, there is not a unique approach that is globally accepted and to which all products \\nand processes, all activities and services of the same series can conform or comply with. Over the years, several  \\nimpact measurement and management models  have been developed by academics, international \\norganizations (such as the UN, ILO, OECD), financial institutions and private organizations (Kah & Akenroye, \\n2020; Rawhouser et al, 2019; Bengo et al, 2016; Grieco et al. 2015). Around 100 sustainability and  impact \\nmanagement and measurement models can be identified (table 4). S ome models aim at supporting \\norganizations and/or investors with proving their governance effectiveness, accountability and transparency through corporate sustainability disclosure (Pr oving Sustainability Models). Other models  focus on aligning \\nthe assessment of  internal management and decision -making practices with organizations’ contributions to \\nthe social and environmental most urgent needs (Aligning with Societal Grand Challenges Models). Some other \\nmodels include the entire process of analysis, monitoring, measurement and management of the short, medium and long term effects of an organization’s activities on the community, in relation to the identified \\nobjectives (Generating Impa ct Models). \\nID Approach  Year of \\ndevelopment  Positioning in the framework  \\nProving  Aligning  Generating  \\n1 AA1000AP  2018     \\n2 Acumen Lean Data  2015     \\n3 Aeris Impact Management Assessment  N/A    \\n4 Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring  2017     \\n5 Atkisson compass assessment for investors  2000     \\n6 B Impact Assessment  2015     \\n7 Best available charitable option (BACO)  2007     \\n8 Bridges Ventures Impact Radar  2013     \\n9 Business Reporting on the SDGs: An Analysis of \\nthe Goals and Targets  2017     \\n10 CDC Impact Grid/Impact Framework  N/A    \\n11 CERISE ALigning INvestors due -diligence and \\nreporting with the Universal Standards  2018     \\n12 CERISE Impact -Driven Investor Assessment  2018     \\n13 CERISE MetODD -SDG 2018     \\n14 CERISE Social Business Scorecard  2018     \\n15 CERISE SPI4  2018     \\n16 Client -Centric Approach: Impact Evaluation that \\nCreates Value for Participants  2015     \\n17 Cradle to cradle certification  2010     \\n18 Dalberg Approach  N/A    \\n19 DCED Standard for Measuring Results in Private \\nSector Development  2017     \\n20 DTA Fit for purpose  2008     24 \\n \\n21 Eco-mapping  1998     \\n22 EPIC Long Term Value Framework  2017     \\n23 Equator Principles  N/A    \\n24 EU Ecomanagement and Audit Scheme (EMAS)  1993     \\n25 EU Technical Expert Group – sustainable finance \\ntaxonomy  2020     \\n26 European Foundation for Quality Management \\nExcellence Model  2002     \\n27 EVPA and SVI Impact Management Principles  2019     \\n28 Expected return (Hewlett Foundation)  2009     \\n29 EY Total Value   N/A    \\n30 Fitch Ratings ESG Relevance Scores  2019     \\n31 FMO ESG Toolkits  N/A    \\n32 GECES Five -step process to impact measurement \\nand management  2013     \\n33 GIIRS Fund Ratings Methodology  2011     \\n34 Gold Standard Certification  N/A    \\n35 GRESB Infrastructure Fund Assessment  2016     \\n36 GRESB Real Estate Assessment  2009     \\n37 GRI sustainability reporting framework  2000     \\n38 HIP Rating  N/A    \\n39 HIPSO Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector \\nOperations  2008     \\n40 IFC Operating Principles for Impact Management  2019     \\n41 Impact Management Project (IMP) Norms and \\nclasses  2019     \\n42 Impact multiple of money (IMM)  2019     \\n43 Impact -Weighted Accounts  2020     \\n44 IRIS + (and IRIS)  2012     \\n45 ISO 14001   N/A    \\n46 ISO 26000   N/A    \\n47 LM3  2002     \\n48 London Stock Exchange Group ESG  Disclosure \\nscore  2019     \\n49 LuxFLAG ESG Label  2014     \\n50 Methodology for impact analysis and assessment \\n(Investing for Good)  2013     \\n51 Methodology for Standardizing and Comparing \\nImpact Performance  2021     \\n52 NPC Impact Risk Classification (IRC)  2018     \\n53 NPC’s charity analysis framework  2016     \\n54 OECD FDI Qualities Indicators  2019     \\n55 OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises   2011     \\n56 OECD measurement of corporates’ impact on \\nwell- being  2017     \\n57 OECD Proposed Impact Standards for Financing \\nSustainable Development  2021     \\n58 Outcome star  2003     \\n59 Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA)  2015     \\n60 Poverty probability Index  2005     \\n61 Practical quality assurance system for small \\norganizations (PQASSO)  1997     \\n62 Product Social Impact Assessment - PRé \\nSustainability  2013     \\n63 Prove It!

In terms of \\nidentity, organizations can prove to be: (i) responsible entities (Proving Sustainability); (ii) actors oriented \\ntoward su stainable development (Aligning with Societal Grand Challenges); (iii) transformative players able to \\nsolve societal challenges (Generating Impact). Finally, transactions between organizations’ stakeholders can \\nbe regulated through: (i) ex -post reporting r esults (Proving Sustainability); (ii) matching ex -ante common goals \\nand targets and ex -post results (Aligning with Societal Grand Challenges); (iii) relationships fitting the interests \\nof all the actors involved in an organization (Generating Impact).  \\nRega rding the main stakeholders interested in the measurement practice results, we can notice that the \\ninformative need of traditional for -profit organisations and responsible investors can be satisfied by \\napproaches with proving sustainability purpose. Instea d, actors that profit actors purpose and sustainable \\ninvestors are guided by approaches aimed at aligning with social grand challenges. Finally, hybrid players and \\nsocial impact investors adopt by approaches with the goal of generating impact.  \\nFinally, a f ew examples of measurement approaches for each category of the taxonomy are reported in the \\nlast row of Figure 5.  \\n27 \\n \\n5. Sustainability and impact management and measurement process  \\n5.1 Process for companies \\nAs seen throughout this chapter, sustainability and impact management and measurement is an important \\nand complex theme, which involve various actors with different objectives in different contexts. In this context, \\nto manage their impact, organizations need a structured process that is able to cover the di fferent objectives \\nand needs related to the generation of positive impact and the mitigation of negative effects. Recently, there \\nhas been considerable progress in developing measurement and evaluation methods, with numerous approaches being developed by practitioners, foundations and impact investors (Ebrahim and Rangan, 2014). \\nThese efforts have led to a great heterogeneity among sustainability and impact measurement models. Some \\nmodels are focused more on one specific aspect of the sustainability and imp act management and \\nmeasurement process. For example, there are models that help an organization align impact with strategies or activities (e.g., IFC’s Operating Principles for Impact Management, Principles for Responsible Investment \\nand Principles for Res ponsible Banking, among others). Other models provide specific sectoral metrics to \\nassess impact (e.g., IRIS+, GRI, SASB standards, among others), while some other models are focused on impact \\nevaluation and communication (e.g., SROI, Impact Weighted Finan cial Account, among others). Nevertheless, \\nseveral models (e.g., Dalberg Approach, EPIC’s Long Term Value Framework, EY Total Value, Impact Multiple \\nof Money, SDGs Compass, Social Impact Assessment, Social return of investment,  among the others) have \\nsimilarities and common points, which make it possible to define a generic process for the management and \\nmeasurement of the impact. This process follows eight interrelated steps.  Each step is briefly explained as \\nfollows\\n. \\nObjective Definition: This is the first step of the process. The Organization should define the objective of the \\nmeasurement (e.g. measure to communicate or measure to improve the impact generation), the unit of \\nanalysis (the organization should want to measure a specific project or strategy, or the impact generated by \\nthe enterprise as a whole) and the available resources in order to schedule a feasible plan of implementation.  \\nContext and Materiality analysis: in this step the organization should analyse the social needs it wants to ta ckle \\nand their relevance related to the context in which it operates. In doing so, the organisations should analyse \\nits stakeholders and could also identify and map the current and potential high impact areas connected to its \\nbusiness.  \\nStrategic Alignment:  the organization define its sustainable or impact statement and mission, aligning its \\nstrategies and processes. In order to do so, the organization could refer to principle like the SDGs principles, the ESG principles, the Principle for Responsible financ e or investment, etc.  \\nImpact Pathways (Social value chain): in this phase there is the analysis of the value creation process. The \\norganization should understand in which way it is generating impact for the society, how its activity and output can generate outcomes and impacts.  The main tool used in this phase is the social value chain.  \\nIndicators and metrics definition: here the organisation has to define in which way it is going to assess its \\nimpacts.  Is it going to use custom or standard indicators, qu antitative or qualitative, or a mix of the two? Is it \\ngoing to monetize all the impact, or just a part of it, if none? Is it possible to define a control sample or is there a benchmark with which compare the results?  \\nData Collection and Analysis: with this  step there is the definition of the sources of information and data \\nrequired for the analysis of the indicator, the collection tool and the timing of the gathering activities. Once the data are collected, it is time for the analysis and the evaluation of the impact.  28 \\n \\nAssurance and Communication: in this phase the organization should consider the assurance of the results, \\nhow to ensure the validity of the entire evaluation process and the best communication strategy to \\ndisseminate the results.  \\nIntegrating in  Operational and strategic process: last, but not least, in order to improve the impact generation, \\nto manage it and to guarantee the endogenization of the impact, the organization should define an action plan to integrate the impact evaluation at a strate gic level and in the organisation long term decision process.  \\n \\nTable 7 - Sustainability and impact management and measurement process for companies \\nIt is important to bear in mind that this is an ‘ideal’ process for managing and me asuring impact. This means \\nthat not all organisations would follow all the steps, because management and measurement models do not \\nnecessarily cover all these activities.  \\n5.2 Process for finance  \\nSimilar to companies, no consensus exists on what ideal process investors should follow to manage their \\nimpact. As such, the one presented here represents an ideal flow of an investment process designed to \\nincorporate impact management and measurement from  the very initial search for investment opportunities \\nto the final divestment operations.   \\nIn general, investment processes (including non-impact  ones too) are divided into phases that are, more or \\nless, always the same when considering equity operations:  initially, investment opportunities are sought in the \\nsectors of interest to the investor, and then the most interesting ones are chosen through a screening phase; \\nsubsequently, there is a due diligence phase that ensures the eligibility of the operation and then the actual \\ninvestment, which continues and is monitored for a certain period of time (usually years) until the investor exits the operation.  \\nIdeally, in the case of impact investments, the investment process should be structured to  go hand in hand \\nwith the  impact management and measurement activities.  All the investment phases should in fact be \\ndesigned to keep track of and maximise the  desired social and/or environmental impact, with the support \\nof internationally  recognised  methods  offering  princ iples,  frameworks,  standards  and metrics  serving  differe\\nnt purposes:  defining  expected impacts,  outlining  and aligning outcome and  impact indicators,  collecting \\ndata,  and finally  assessing impact in order to communicate  it to the outside world.     \\n29 \\n \\nThe origination  phase  of the investment process  is key to defining and incorporating impact principles into the \\ninvestment strategy: the three key pillars forming the Impact Triad  - intentionality, measurability and \\nadditionality - guide the search for investment opportunities, which are selected among those showing from \\nthe very beginning  a potential effective contribution to one, or preferably more, SDGs.    \\nThe screening  stage involves a preliminary feasibility analysis of the investment opportunities identified in the \\nprevious phase.  Here,  a preliminary analysis  of the investment opportunities based on  ESG criteria is \\nperformed to assess whether such investments can actually qualify as  sustainable . More precisely, an ESG Acid \\nTest is performed:  this assesses, qua ntitatively, the degree to which the investment considers potential risks \\noccurring across ESG criteria and makes a positive contribution to a number of macro -themes selected in the \\nESG area1. If the ESG Acid Test  is positive, the investment is eligible fo r generating value out of ESG criteria. To \\nensure this,  it is verified that the principles of the Impact Triad are met and that the SDGs previously \\ndetermined are consistently addressed.    \\nFor those investment opportunities that are considered worth pursui ng, a specific assessment, the Social and \\nEnvironmental Impact Due Diligence , will be carried out to estimate and quantify the potential impact of the \\ninvestment.  Here,  the design of the impact measurement and management takes the lead:  the logic model of \\nimpact generation is built through a  Theory of Change , which describes how and why a project is supposed to \\nlead to a desired impact (environmental and/or social).  \\nIn the actual  investment  phase,  it is fundamental to guarantee  the full integration of impa ct criteria into the \\ninvestment agreement.  For this purpose, KPIs -  at output, outcome and impact level  – are defined, together \\nwith the  related achievement targets.  International frameworks such as, for example,  GIIN’s  IRIS Catalog  of \\nMetrics  and IRIS+ Co re Metrics Sets  are usually adopted during this phase to  support standardisation  and to \\nensure  comparability  in terms of  communication of impact results.   \\nThe monitoring  phase  aims to track progress against previously determined impact targets  (KPIs).  This stage is \\nalso dedicated to supporting the verification of the achievement of impact objectives, highlighting any \\ndeviation between predetermined targets and actual results.  Such verification  can be carried out at different \\nintervals: usually a period be tween six months and a year is chosen.   \\nFinally, in the final stage of  divestment , the impact results obtained through the investment are quantified, \\nwith a final  Impact  Report indicating whether the investment was successful or not.  Since it is fundamenta l to \\nconsider that actual impact objectives, intended as the portion of the total outcome that occurred as a direct result of the intervention,  are reachable and  assessable only in the long term,  it is important that the \\nimpactful activities initiated by t he investment continue after its closure. For this purpose,  the final Impact \\nReport should include  mission -lock clauses  that guarantee the preservation of the social and/or environmental \\nimpact results of the initiative even after its  disposal  by the inves tor. \\n  30 \\n \\n \\nTable 8 - Sustainability and impact management and measurement process for finance  \\n6. Impact measurement: methodological issues  \\nAs seen throughout this chapter, accounting for impact requires organizations to make strategic measurement \\nchoices. Whether attempting to prove their sustainability, align  with societal grand challenges or generate \\nimpact, organizations that approach imp act measurement models and standards inevitably embark on a \\nresearch process, which can be contentious and debated (Scriven, 2013) . Differently from more general \\napplied research projects (e.g. explorator y studies), measuring impact is all about making  causal / attributional \\nclaims (i.e. causality or causation)  (Donaldson et al. , 2009) . The robustness of cau sal claims has for long \\ncoincided with robustness of methods, with traditional social experiments being at the top of a hierarchy of \\nevidence  (Craig et al. , 2008; Shadish et al. , 2002) . However, as social interventions are needing more \\ncompound explanations to respond to increasingly multifaceted social and environme ntal issues (McHugh et \\nal., 2017; O’Mara -Eves et al., 2013) , such hierarchy has been put into question (Nathanson, 2007; Petticrew, \\n2011) , especially when applied to innovative organizations that operate in open society (Bertotti et al. , 2018; \\nCaló et al. , 2019; Picciotto, 2012; Rifkin, 2014; Van Belle et al. , 2016) .  \\nThe raising of concerns about the role of traditional experimentalism in measuring impact has shifted \\ndiscourses about causality from being mono -paradigmatic instances to becoming pluralistic and \\nmethodological (Gates and Dyson, 2017) . Appr oaching impact measurement and enacting approaches and \\nstandards  now requires practitioners and academics to posit questions about (a) what reality is ( ontology ), (b) \\nhow to make sense of it ( epistemology or what constitutes scientific knowledge), and the extent to which \\ncausal claims should be retained from a value viewpoint ( axiology ) (Cartwr ight, 2007) . In the light of this \\nheterogeneous understanding of causality, measuring impact now represents a plethora of possibilities, all of which with different understandings of causality that vary by \\nresearch paradigms .   \\nResearch paradigms can be  understood as a set of assumptions and beliefs from which causal claims about \\nreality are generated. Paradigms guide the study of any phenomena. In the realm of impact studies, paradigms \\ndetermine:  \\n• researchers’ ontological commitments to generalisable ex planations of interventions (i.e., theory ); \\n• how generalisable explanations are inferred (i.e., inferential thinking  or inference ); \\n31 \\n \\n• how inferred explanations are empirically substantiated (i.e.,  study  designs and data collection and \\nanalysis methods ). \\nThere exist several paradigms in the realm of scientific research, but methodological literatures identify four \\nmain paradigmatic pillars: historical positivism, social constructionism, post -positivism, critical realism. These \\nparadigms are outlined in the foll owing figure and discussed in depth in the next section of this chapter, \\nalongside their implications for impact measurement processes.  \\n  Paradigms  \\n  Positivism  Post -positivism  Social constructivism  Realism  Methodological choices  Reality is …  Stable and  regular \\nsuccession  of events that \\nfollow a law -like logic  Regular succession of events \\nsubject to changes  (i.e. not \\nstable events)  Plural and made of subjective \\nexperiences  Stratified and composed of \\nevents/outcomes and deep \\ncauses (structures) that exert  \\na real power over \\nevents/outcomes  \\nCausal claims are \\npursued through \\n… Hypothesis verification : \\nverify concurrence of two or \\nmore events (X follows Y, \\ntherefore every X follows Y)  \\n \\nInduction   Hypothesis falsification : \\nfalsify concurrence of two or \\nmore events (X follows Y, \\ntherefore every X follows Y)  \\n \\nDeduction  Subjective interpretations  and \\nmeanings attribution  \\n \\nInduction  Explanations  of the \\ntendencies between \\nobservable events/outcomes \\nand non -observable causes  \\n \\nAbduction  \\nImpact is assessed \\nthrough …  Randomized experiments or \\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) –   \\n \\nCounterfactual logic  Theory -driven social \\nexperimentation (RCTs; \\nquasi- experiments; \\nobservational studies) –  \\n \\nCounterfactual logic  Qualitative studies (single or \\nmultiple case studies or \\nethn ographic journeys).  \\n \\nConstant conjunction logic  Mixed -methods realist \\nevaluation studies where \\ntheory and empirical data are \\nmutually informative  \\n \\nGenerative logic  \\nMeasurement \\nconsists of …  Quantifiable data  collected \\nthrough e.g.: validated \\nscales or objective \\nmeasurements (e.g., blood \\nsamples, monitoring of \\nphysical activity, financial \\ntransactions)  Quantifiable data  collected \\nthrough e.g.: validated \\nscales, objective \\nmeasurements, new \\ntechnologies such as digital \\ndiaries, big data  Non-quantifiable (qualitative) \\ndata  collected through e.g.: \\nunstructured or semi-\\nstructured (video) interviews, \\nfocus groups, observations, \\narchival research and \\nartifacts collection  Quantifiable and non -\\nquantifiable (qualitative)  data  \\ncollected through different \\nmethods (scales, objective \\nmeasurements, interviews, \\nfocus groups, observations \\nand artifacts)  \\nImpact claims are \\nverified through …  Statistical analysis  (e.g., t -\\ntests, regression analysis)  Statistical analysis  that is \\ncomplex, theoretically \\nsupported and that can \\nfollow different types of \\ninferences  Thematic and content analysis  \\nto organize evidence of \\nimpacts through meaningful \\ncategories and stakeholders’ \\nvoices  Configurational analysis  \\n(what works, for whom and \\nwhy) of quantitative (and \\nqualitative  data to develop \\nprogramme theories  \\nTable 9 - Methodological issues to consider for sustainability and impact measurement  \\n6.1 Historical positivism: verification, induction, randomised experiments  \\nHistorical positivism has its formal origin in the thinking and vision of science promoted by the French \\nphilosopher August Comte (1789 -1857), as well as by David Hume (1711 –1776) and his empiricist vision of \\nscientific knowledge (Weinberg, 2013) . This paradigm promotes a successionist understanding of causality , in \\nthat reality is seen as a stable and regular succession of events that follow a law-like logic  and deterministi cally \\ngovern human actions (Bryman, 2012) . At an epistemological level, positivism recognises that the truth about \\nthe world (and therefore interventions) can be pursued scientifically through direct observations  of these \\nregular empirical manifestations (Denzin, 2010) . For historical positivists, causal explanation is however \\nontologically inaccessible  per se  (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) . In historical positivists’ view, theory  should hold \\ntrue and value -free only when direct observation of empirical events verifies the presence of a constant \\nconcurrence of two or more events (e.g. X follows Y, therefore e very X follows Y ) (Mohr, 2009) . With theory \\nbeing confined to the status of direct product of empirical scrutiny, positivists rely on epistemic primacy  (i.e., 32 \\n \\nreality is what we can observe) and inductive inferential thinking  (i.e., theory verification from single empirical \\ncases or a sequence thereof).  \\nIn applied impact research, this thinking has been historically guided mainly through randomized experiments \\nor controlled trials  (RCTs ). RCTs are  experimental designs through which researchers control for any external \\nsources of variations that may confound interventions’ impacts on study units such people, animals, \\ninstitutions. Interventions’ impacts are isolated from external disturbance via randomization, whereby \\ndifferent conditions (i.e., different interventions and lack thereof) are assigned to study units by chance (e.g. \\nby coin toss or table of random numbers)  to create groups that are comparable at baseline (i.e. before an \\nintervention) but that undergo different conditions (Shadish et al. , 2002) . Then, conditions are contrasted by \\ncalculating the differences between impact study units’ outc ome responses (i.e., counterfactual inference - \\nwhat would happen if the intervention was not there). More precisely, any differences between the groups that are observed once the impact study is completed are then likely to be attributed to the interventi on of \\ninterest and not to confounding effects (Banerjee et al. , 2015) . In such a vein, RCT researchers verify the \\neffectiveness of an intervention by suppressing any contextual va riation regardless of its theoretical \\nimportance.  \\nRCTs require  data that are quantifiable . These are mostly collected through universally  validated scales  or \\nobjective measurements  (e.g., blood samples, monitoring of physical activity, financial transacti ons) of \\noutcomes of interest and, less frequently, through researchers’ own scales. Scales and objective measurements generate quantifiable information that undergo \\nstatistical analysis  through techniques such as \\nt-tests  and forms of  multilevel regression analyses  to account for subgroup differences.  \\nForms of impact measurement that are purely underpinned by tenets of historical positivism are nowadays very rare (Bonell  et al. , 2018) . There is evidence that historical positivism plays a redundant role in recent \\nforms of impact measurement that uses new forms of social experimentation, including more theoretically -\\ndriven RCTs (Corry et al. , 2019) . The role of historical positivism has however been critical for the development \\nof other logics of enquiry that have guided impact measurement and causality attribution. These include social \\nconstructivist, postpositivist and critical realist responses to (or critiques of) historical positivism.  \\n6.2 Post -positivism: falsification, deduction, new social experimentations  \\nHistorical positivism has been highly critiqued for its internal inconsistencies. These critiques have been moved \\nby authors that the literature labels as empirical post- positivists (Corry et al. , 2019) . Among t hese authors, the \\nphilosopher of science Karl Popper (1902 -1994) conceptualised historical positivism’s inconsistencies as lying \\nin the false assumption that knowledge is an inductive and empirical process of hypothesis verification \\n(Popper, 2005) . The main challenge Popper presented to historical positivists’ statements about causality was \\nthat if any observed successions of regular events is held as verified theory, then science will never be able to \\noffer generalisable explanations (Popper, 2005) . In Popper’s view, the process of verification implies uncritical \\nacceptance of theories because sensory information remains decontextualised (i.e.  the questions scientists \\nask, how the world is observed and measured) and, thus, subject to external validity issues (Popper, 2013) .  \\nBy placing importance on the context of empirical observation, Popper advocated for a theory -laden science , \\nwhereby observations and experimentation can only come after thorough consideration of what theories tell \\nus about the world, so that tested theorie s can be externally valid (Popper, 2013) . In Popper’s view, causality \\nis pursued via falsification and deductive reasoning , whereby hypotheses  are constructed via careful evidence d-\\nbased theorizing  and, then, tested through observations and social experimentation (Popper, 2014) . In such \\nan approach, Popper recognized that ontological empiricism, value -free knowledge and empirical facts are \\ncontingent upon researchers’ action (Corry et al. , 2019) , and that the  constant conjunctions between facts can \\nno longer be the starting point to explain interventions (Bonell et al. , 2012) . 33 \\n \\nPopper’s rejection of historical positivism’s sensory primacy and recognition that science needs authorial \\nscrutiny and appraisal of context (i .e., questioning how reality is observed and theories falsified) had important \\nimplications for contemporary impact assessment research. In the wake of Popper’s thoughts, impact studies have witnessed new \\ncomplex forms for social experimentation  which, for  being considered particularly suitable \\nto explain complex and innovative interventions, finds now plain legitimacy in policy (Bonell et al. , 2012) . These \\nforms of theory -engaged social experimentation include new- generation:  \\n• RCTs using theories of change and qualitative study components;  \\n• quasi -experiments (including natural experiments);  \\n• nonexperimental or observational  studies .  \\nAll these types of studies, differently from historical positivist RCTs, rely on the principle of falsification, and make use of ext ensive theory to rule out as many as alternative explanations as possible instead of confirming \\njust one hypothesis (Shadish et al. , 2002) .  \\nRCTs which respond to post -positivist tenets nowadays widely used in impact studies. These new- generation \\nRCTs, which preserve most of the underpinning features of historical positivist randomized experiments (i.e., randomization, control over units’ exposure to interventions; suppression of confounding effects), have been \\nre-examined by scholars and  adapted to more complex forms of interventions that operate across different \\ncontextual conditions and that can have multiple explanations. RCTs of this kind, for example those promoted \\nby the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), are guided by initial \\ntheor ies of change , and are supported through \\nqualitative data to identify all the contextual conditions that may account for variation of impact across \\nconditions of interest (Craig et al. , 2008) . In other words, these types RTCs aim to falsify, theoretically, all the \\npotential explanations of impacts before measuring and isolating the actual impacts of inter ventions.  \\nQuasi -experiments  are impact measurement design features that, similar to RCTs, seek to follow a counter \\nfactual logic, but they lack randomization. More intuitively, quasi -experiments deal with self-selection or \\nnatural occurring contrasts betw een conditions  (e.g. before and after covid),  in that units that do (not) undergo \\na specific condition can be compared, alternatively:  \\n• within the same group ( before and after quasi -experiments );  \\n• between groups ( controlled quasi -experiments ); \\n• within and b etween groups ( before and after controlled quasi -experiments ) \\nIn quasi -experiments, researchers can either partially manipulate an interventional condition to force it to \\noccur or hypothesize its effects before it naturally occurs. However, because they ca nnot exercise full control \\non conditions, quasi -experiment researchers need to account for disturbance at baseline (i.e., before an \\nintervention occurs) and control for this over the whole study period. Quasi -experiments can do this through \\ntheoretically i nformed design controls . For example, researchers can add supplementary control groups by \\nidentifying, through theory, what type of conditions would otherwise lead to the impacts that are similar to those hypothesized for the intervention of interest. Alternatively, or in conjunction with multiple control \\ngroups, researchers can also add multiple points of observations of specific proxies of interest before an \\nintervention occurs or is chosen by the units. This is usually done when theory suggests that, for  example, \\nspecific interventions can occur or a chosen by units cyclically. Examples of quasi -experiments with this kind \\nof multiple design controls are \\ncontrolled  interrupted  time series . In these quasi -experimental designs, the \\nunits of analysis are asse ssed multiple times against the main impact proxies before and after an intervention \\noccurs, and between different interventional conditions. By relying of multiple pre and post observations \\nacross different conditions, quasi -experimenters may be able to exclude different alternative hypotheses and \\nisolate the effectiveness of a specific intervention, while informing the impacts of other types of conditions. Quasi -experiment researchers can also further control for any self -selection or natural occurring bi as by means \\nof \\nstatistical controls. By means of theoretically informed variables, quasi -experiment researchers can also 34 \\n \\naccount for any cofounding effects at a proxy level, thus ruling out any potential emerging associations \\nbetween units’ exposure to an intervention and non -interventional factors. However, compared to design \\ncontrols, statistical controls are less supportive of causal claims because they operate at observational level \\nand not at units of observation level.  \\nNonexperimental designs are, as their name suggests, impact studies that lack both randomization and \\nelements of design controls. A such, they do not support counterfactual inference. More precisely, these \\ndeigns do not allow researchers to exercise control over interventions and /or conditions, and therefore they \\nare commonly defined as observational studies . These studies can take several design features such as, for \\nexample, cohort studies , case -control studies  and cross -sectional studies . Compared to RCTs and quasi -\\nexperiments,  nonexperimental designs firstly identify units’ exposure to an intervention or an event of \\ninterest, and then they observe whether and when the impact occurs with or without comparators. As such, \\nnonexperimental studies have a temporal framework to assess  causality (Song and Chung, 2010) .  \\nRCTs, quasi -experiments and nonexperimental impact studies require  data that are quantifiable . Although \\nthese studies may be supported by theory and a qualitative component (e.g. Theory of Change), they always \\nassess impacts quantitatively. Data are usually collected through validated scales , objective measurements  \\n(e.g., blood samples, monitoring of physical activity, financial transactions) and also through newly designed  \\ninstruments for data collection (e.g. new technologies such as digital quantitative diaries, big data). Scales and \\nobjective measurements generate quantifiable information that undergo statistical analysis  that is complex, \\ntheoretically supported and that  can follow different types of inferences (e.g., frequentist versus Bayesian \\ninference).   \\n6.3 Social constructivism: pluralism, induction, qualitative methods  \\nSocial constructivism is generally defined as a paradigmatic umbrella of approaches to science that jointly \\nreject historical positivism’s ideas of a unique truth made of regular succession of events (Bryman, 2012) . \\nSocial constructivism recognises that social reality has no intrinsic properties , because it is mostly the \\nunderstanding of the world and the common sense that form around it via subjective experiences  (Berger and \\nLuckmann, 2011) . For this reason, social constructivists are epistemologically engaged with subjective \\ninterpretations  and meanings attribution , which are derived from personal, cultural and temporal e xperiences \\nof phenomena  (Guba and Lincoln, 1 989) . \\nSocial constructivism does not convey a unique epistemic recipe (i.e. what validates their knowledge), because made of several approaches (i.e. \\nphenomenology , hermeneutics , critical theory , and postmodern \\ndeconstructionism , among others) that acquire and justify their understanding of social constructions to \\ndifferent degrees and depth (Marques, 2017) . To mention a few of these approaches, phenomenological \\nendeavours framed within Edmund Husserl’s (1887 –1938) transcendental idealism focus on the ‘intentionality \\nof human consciousness’ (Spiegelberg, 2013, p. 107) . According to this approach, the actual content of human \\nexperiences is the only validated unit of knowledge, because res earchers remain unable to capture the mental \\nprocesses that stand behind such content production (Lynch and Peyrot, 1992) . Hermeneutical research \\nenterprises (e.g. objective and alethic, among several others) push further phenomenologists’ efforts, and \\ndedicate themselves to th e dialectic between meanings and their historical contextualisation (Mann and \\nSchweiger, 2009) . Informed by neoidealist tenets grounded in Martin Heidegger’s (1917 –1976) and Hans -\\nGeorg Gadamer’s (1900 -2002) thinking, hermeneutics aims to reconstruct the subtle meanings through the \\nsystematic study of language and its context of application (Wagenaar, 2007) . On a more complex level, critical \\ntheory and its emancipatory pull inherited from Karl Marx’s (1818 –1883) historical materialism a im to expose \\nthe oppressive power of structures (e.g. inequalities) through individuals’ experiences and meaning making \\n(Klecun and Cornford, 2005) . Compared to phenomenologists and hermeneutists, critical theorists add \\ncomplexity to social cons tructionism’ epistemic efforts, because they understand that experiences ought to 35 \\n \\nbe validated by the appraisal of unconscious mental processes deriving from “ideologies, power relations, and \\nother oppressions” (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017, p. 218) . Finally, postmodern -poststructuralist turns posit \\nquestions on the validi ty of phenomenological, hermeneutical and critical constructions; they do it by \\ndeconstructing constructions via reflexive practices (Rosenau et al. , 1992) . Drawing upon a sentiment of \\ninsecurity, scepticism and relativism following the Second World War, p ostmodernists and poststructuralists \\nrecognise the importance of meaning and experience as valid units of knowledge, but their interpretation \\nremains to be considered as the product of an elaborated process of sense making that is filtered through \\nresearch ers’ experiences (Rosenau, 2015) . \\nSocial constructivist impact studies mostly focuses on the ‘experienced’ (i.e. multiple realities) when it comes \\nto the appraisal of interventions (Clarke and Dawson, 1999) . The sense making of such experiences is usually \\ntheory -laden, such that g rand theories (e.g. broad and very abstract theoretical frameworks such as, for \\nexample, ‘integration’) are used to frame the construction of individual experiences of interventions (Barnes \\net al. , 2003) . However, in social constructivist traditions, theories are never conceived as the ultimate and true \\nexplanatory models for programmes; rather, new knowledge constantly enriches theories with new \\nconstructions (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017) . With theory being never conducive to actual knowledge \\nproduction, social constructivists rely on inductive inference and value -engaged research ; they make use of \\nthese strategies to report on proc esses of sense making across programme stakeholders (i.e. multiple realities) \\nwithout pronouncing “which set of perceptions was ‘right’ or more ‘true’ or more ‘real’” (Patton, 2014, p. 98) .  \\nIn practice, impact measurement studies that embrace social co nstructivist traditions materialize mostly as \\nqualitative studies . These studies explore, in -depth, the lived experiences of interventions’ stakeholders (e.g., \\norganizations’ managers, clients, funders, regulators). They require impact evaluators immersing  themselves \\nin the real dynamics of interventions and/or organizations. Therefore, these studies can be particularly time \\nconsuming. These studies are generally designed as single  or multiple case studies or ethnographic journeys . \\nThey employ data collecti on methods that are of discursive nature. For example: unstructured  or semi -\\nstructured (video) interviews , focus groups , observations , archival research  (Bryman, 2012)  and artifacts \\ncollection , among others. These studies require researchers to engage with textual/visual data and make sense \\nof interventions’ impacts through stakeholders’ words or artifacts. Common forms o f analysis of qualitative \\ndata that are typical of these impact studies are inductive thematic and content analysis,  which allow \\nresearchers to organize evidence of interventions’ impacts through meaningful categories and stakeholders’ voices (Vaismoradi et al. , 2013) .  \\n6.4 Critical realism : generative causation , abdu ction, mixed methods  \\nCritic al realism is a paradigm that opposes positivist and social constructionist understanding of reality and \\nreduction of causal explanation to the social acquisition of knowledge (Bhaskar, 1975) . Critical realism pursues \\nontological depth, that is to say it questions reality as existent and objective, emergent, independent from \\nhuman knowledge and never reducible to scientific statements , which a re always open to review and therefore \\nfallible (Sayer, 2000) . Critical realism sees reality as  stratified  and composed of experiences, events/outcomes \\nand deep structures that exert a real power over events/outcomes  (Bhaskar, 1975) . More precisely, critical \\nrealism states that the world is hierarchically ordered (Archer, 1995)  and made of real, actual and empirical \\ndomains, where:  \\n• the real domain  comprises structures and their causal potential or power (i.e. mechanisms) that \\ncannot  be directly observed;  \\n• the actual domain , which is a subset of the real domain, contains events that are actualised (i.e. \\ngenerated by real mechanisms) and that embody change (i.e. produce effects) that can be \\nexperienced;  36 \\n \\n• the empirical domain , which a sub set of both the real and actual domains, contains actors’ experiences \\nof the actualised events from the real domain and they can be directly observed (Mingers et al. , 2013) .  \\nFor example, the effects of inequalities can be directly observed by interviewing/survey people to appraise \\nwhether they believe they have experienced/perceived any outcomes due to avoidable factors (e.g. people \\nbelieve their asthma worsened due to lack of money to heath and de -humidify their house; people believe \\ntheir pension is too low due to long -term unemplo yment and early retirement). The actual level represents \\npeople’s right to specific inequalities being fulfilled or neglected. Such right is ultimately explainable at the real \\nlevel, where the unobservable power factors such as, for example, age and social  class are fired.  \\nCritical realism states that knowledge construction and, therefore, science should be engaging with explaining \\nthe real domain and how it relates to the actual and empirical domains (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017) . For \\nbeing engaged with explaining something that cannot be directly observed (i.e. the real domai n), critical realist \\nconcept of causality shifts from being the product of a direct observation of events, to being inferred from a \\nmore complex analysis of tendencies  (i.e. relationships) between the different domains of reality (Lawson, \\n1989) . These tendencies, in realists’ view, are never fully predictable and universal, because they are complex \\nor, according to Danermark et al.\\'s (2002, p. 21) ; they are the result of what “we experience, what actually \\nhappens, and the underlying mechanisms that produce the events in the world\". More precisely, these \\ntendencies are seen as demi -regular, and they  are the product of the interaction of certain causal powers in \\nthe real domain which Bhaskar name as ‘generative mechanisms’ (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017) .  \\nTo explain how generative mechanisms  are activated and lead to actualised events and individual experiences, \\ncritical realists rely on the concepts of analytical dualism and temporality  (Archer, 1995) . Through analytical \\ndualism, critical realism conceptualises structures  and agency  as independent entities that have differ ent but \\nrelated ontological properties (Sayer, 2000) . By structure critical realists mean institutions and roles; by agency \\nthey mean a stratification of sense of self, personal identity and social identity through time and contexts \\n(Archer, 1995; Westaway et al. , 2019) . Critical realists assume that structures operate independently from \\nagency, but they are also dependent on although not reducible to them (Archer, 2015) . This separation \\nattempts to uncover the process of how structures shape agency and, in turn, how agency contributes to either a new structuring or order of the world (i.e. morphogenesis ), or a reproduction of the preceding \\nstructures or order (i.e. morphostasis ) via, respectively, the activation of generative mechanisms or lack \\nthereof (Archer, 1995) . This process is conceived by critical realist as time dependent, whereby “(i) structure \\nnecessarily predate the action(s) of agents that transform it; and (ii) that structure necessarily postdates t hose \\nactions”  (Archer, 1995, p. 168) . \\nSupporters of critical realism see the research process as necess arily engaged with such complex dynamics \\nbetween structures and agency and, therefore, they disregard both “methodological individualism (a focus on \\nthe actors level) and holism (a focus on the collective level)”  (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017, p. 52) . Critical \\nrealists believe that “we do not uncover real struct ures by interviewing people in -depth about them” (Archer, \\n1998, p. 199) . Critical realists recognise that structures and their interplays with agency need more \\nsophisticated explanations, in which theory plays a fundamental role to: (a) make sense of and abstract from \\nhow people experience (i.e. empirical data) their structur al conditions; (b) explain how generative mechanisms \\nchange the social order and lead to impact (Bhaskar, 1998) .  \\nBy considering theory and empirical data as mutually informative and essential to advance causal explanation of how real mechanisms can change the social order, critical realist researchers operate throug h abductive \\nand retroductive inferential thinking  (Danermark et al. , 2002) . Abductive inference, formally conceptualised \\nby the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (Peirce, 1932), is understood by realist researchers as a \\nperformative way  to make sense of data that do not fall under apriori theorizing and, thus, to complement the \\nfallible nature of human knowledge production (i.e. preceding theories)  (Laurier Decoteau, 2017) . More \\nprecis ely, abduction looks at how new empirical evidence can enrich informative theories and broaden and 37 \\n \\nreview pre- existing understanding of how real mechanisms (do not) lead to a new social order (Fletcher, 2017) . \\nRetroduction, on the other hand, is conceived by critical realists as an inferential exercise that follows \\nabduction. It r econciles new abductive discovery with pre -existing knowledge to form new advanced theories \\nabout reality, so to c omplement the fallible nature of human knowledge production (i.e. in this case \\nempirically -driven knowled ge) (Bhaskar, 1998). In more accurate terms, retroduction represents a \\nconceptualising endeavour that entails researchers engaging with advancing statements about reality by identifying the conditions in which something cannot exist (Danermark et al. , 2002) . Practically, this is done by \\n“moving backward and forward among empirical data, research literature, and emergent theory” (Dey and \\nTeasdale, 2013 , p. 255).  \\nDespite widely adopted in the realm of science (Clark et al. , 2007) , critical realism generally remains “a \\nphilosophy for and not about science” and, thus, it “does not engage with methodological matters much” \\n(Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2017, p. 53) . However, in recent years, critical realist stances have fruitfully informed \\nimpact measurements (McEvoy and Richards, 2006) . Critical realism has informed a specific theory -driven \\napproach to impact evaluation: re alist evaluation  (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) .  \\nRealist evaluation is a relatively recent but widely accepted approach to impa ct evaluation that has been \\nemployed by researchers and public policy evaluators (Marchal et al. , 2010; Mukumbang et al. , 2018; Pawson, \\n2016) . Realist evaluation was conceptualised by Pawson and Tilley (1997)  and it draws on Bhaskar’s critical \\nrealist critique of positivist and constructivist traditions (Bhaskar, 1975) . Realist evaluation acknowledges the \\nepistemic idea of overabundance of explanatory possibilities  in the social world, and it rejects the idea that \\nempirical endeavou r requires closed systems (i.e. historical positivist RCTs) (Pawson, 2006) . In realist \\nevaluation terms, the objects of science (i.e. interventions) are partially closed, because they operate in \\ncomplex contexts (i.e. society) and not in laboratories (Pawson, 2013) . Interventions, even when they have the \\nsame format or are part of the same family, will always respond to the context in which they operate and, thus, they will never b ehave the same way (Pawson, 2006) . The reason for this is that interventions are social \\nsystems and, thus, made of indivi duals and institutions, micro and macro processes that interact and \\ncomplement each other (Pawson and Tilley 1997).  \\nRealist evaluation appreciates that interventions or organizations are theories incarnate , that is to say they are \\ncompound and underlying assumptions or hypotheses that account for how and why activities are delivered \\nin certain ways to create impacts, for whom and under what circumstances (Pawson, 2013) . In realist \\nevaluation terms, these assumptions are not always explicit, because the ingredients of interventions are \\nmultiple and complex, sometimes hidden, and therefore in need of compound u npacking (Pawson, 2006) . The \\nduty of realist evaluation is, therefore, to make sense of such ingredients and make interventions’ underlying \\nassumptions explicit.  \\nTheories are the core of realist evaluation, and these are constructed via iterative conceptualisation, empirical \\ndata collection, analysis and conceptual refinements (Mukumbang et al. , 2018) . To guide the construction and \\ntesting of a programme theory of an intervention, realist researchers rely on clear ontological assumptions. \\nFor realist evaluators, knowledge construction is the best match researchers can do between actually -existing \\nmechanisms of society (i.e. ontological argument) and the mechanisms they propose to account for \\ninterventions’ impacts (Williams, 2018) . Realist evaluation is therefore method neutral  and can be seen as a \\npragmatic way to mix quantitative and qualitative methods and multiple study designs . Choices of methods \\nare essentially underpinned by what an intervention aims to do and how and for whom it is hypothesized to \\nwork and produce an impact in a specific context (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) .  \\nRealist evaluation explains interventions through programme theories that describe how context activates (or \\nfires or triggers) the mechanisms that lead to outcomes. This is d one by realist evaluators through the \\ncategorical formula or heuristics: Context + Mechanisms = Outcomes  (CMOs or CMO configurations) (Pawson, \\n2013) . Thus, programme theories are not limited to describing causal direction between interventions’ 38 \\n \\ncomponents (Chen, 2014) . Rather, they stand as either prospective or retrospective hypotheses that seek to \\ndescribe the social world and its mechanisms under certain conditions and through the interactions of several \\ncomponents. These components may include an interventions’ design, objectives, resources and actors \\n(Goodridge et al. , 2015) . \\nRealist programme theories can be constructed and tested in several ways by mixing different study designs \\n(e.g. qualitative case studies, ethnographies, quasi -experiments, nonexperimental studies) and employing \\ndifferent data collection methods. Lately, some scholars have also conceptualised realist RCTs (Bonell et al. , \\n2012) . However, realist evaluations are never conducted through only quantitative approaches, because \\ngenerative mechanisms are hidden and can only be theorized. Overall, choosing from three main approaches is usually recommended to conduct realist evaluation. These approaches are recommended by existing \\nreporting standards for realist evaluation (Wong et al. , 2016) . The first approach includes: (a)  advancing \\nprogramme theories through existing literature; (b) testing programme theories through qualitative methods. \\nThe second approach to the formulation of a programme theory includes building and testing programme \\ntheories through primary research (i .e. data collection from the field). This approach mainly relies on \\nstakeholders’ assumptions about a programme, as well as on researchers’ embeddedness in the intervention \\nor their experience and professional knowledge in the field (Shearn et al. , 2017) .  The third approach to \\nprogramme theory construction, testing and refinement combines the two previous approaches. For example, \\nMukumbang et al. (2018)  have developed a programme theory of an antiretr oviral treatment adherence club \\nintervention in South Africa using three methods. First, they conducted a scoping review to identify \\nexplanatory theories (and underlying generative mechanisms) underpinning antiretroviral therapy adherence \\nclub intervention s. Second, they conducted a qualitative study to explore programme designers’ and \\nmanagers’ assumptions of the intervention and advance preliminary programme theories. Finally, through a \\nmixed -method study ( interviews plus a cohort design ), they tested their programme theories and refined \\nthem.  \\nRealist evaluations can make use of different analytical strategies to make sense of both quantitative and qualitative data collected through different types of instruments (e.g. interviews, observations, focus group s, \\nscales and objective measurements, archival research). Therefore, there is no single recipe for realist \\nevaluators.  \\n \\n \\n  39 \\n \\nAnnexes  \\nGRI sustainability reporting framework  \\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  is an international independent organization that helps businesses, \\ngovernments and other organizations understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability \\nissues such as climate change, human rights, corruption and many others. Its main objective is to make \\nsustainability reporting a routine for all organisations, similar to financial reporting. By using the GRI \\nGuidelines, reporting organizations disclose their most critical impacts –  either positive or negative –  on \\nenvironment, society and economy. They can generate reliable, releva nt and standardized information with \\nwhich to assess opportunities and risks, and enable more informed decision- making – both within the \\norganisations and among their stakeholders.  \\nGRI’s core product are the Sustainability Reporting Standards  which are mad e available as a free public good. \\nGRI Standards are the first and most widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting and they have been continuously developed over 20 years. The Standards are designed as an easy -to-use modular set, \\nstarting  with the universal Standards. Topic Standards are then selected, based on the organization\\'s material \\ntopics – economic, environmental or social. This process ensures that the sustainability report provides an \\ninclusive picture of material topics, their r elated impacts, and how they are managed.  \\nIn particular, GRI defined the Reporting Principles, which can be divided into two groups:  \\n1. Principles for defining report content.  To help organizations decide what content to include in the \\nreport. This includes a n analysis of the organization\\'s activities and impacts and the real interests and \\nexpectations of its stakeholders:  \\na. Stakeholders inclusivity , It will be necessary to identify who are the stakeholders of the \\norganization, their expectations and interests a nd how the company intends to deal with them \\n(Stakeholders Analysis);  \\nb. Sustainability contest , the information must be communicated by contextualizing the \\nsustainability context in which they occurred;  \\nc. Materiality , the report must contain information on the  aspects that: reflect the significant \\neconomic, social and environmental impacts of the organization and that influence the decisions and assessments of stakeholders (Materiality Analysis) ; \\nd. Completeness , the information presented in the report must be suf ficient to reflect the \\neconomic, social and environmental impacts and to allow stakeholders to adequately assess performance  \\n2. Principles for defining report quality.  To guide choices to ensure the quality of information in a \\nsustainability report, including  its adequate presentation:  \\na. Accuracy , the information reported must be sufficiently accurate and detailed to be able to \\nevaluate the performance of the organization ; \\nb. Balance, the report must contain both positive and negative information regarding the \\nperformance of the organization ; \\nc. Clarity , the information reported must be clear, therefore presented in an understandable \\nand accessible way to all users of the report;  \\nd. Comparability , the information reported must allow comparative analyzes to be carried out \\nwith reference to performance over time and with respect to other organizations ; \\ne. Reliability , It will have to communicate about the processes implemented to collect, compile, \\nanalyze and communicate the information reported to allow users to verify the  quality and \\nmateriality of the information ; 40 \\n \\nf. Timeliness , the preparation of the report must take place on a regular basis, furthermore the \\nperformances must refer to a homogeneous period  \\nGRI Sustainability Reporting Standards do not only include the guide lines for sustainability reporting. Alongside \\nthese, there is also an implementation manual, which specifies the protocols of the indicators and the technical \\nprotocols for the application of the principles, and the sector supplements.  \\n \\nUsing the GRI Standards for sustainability reporting (Source: GRI 2018)  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n ESG performance ratings \\n \\n \\nOvers 1.000 ESG ratings and indices exist globally as of 2018 and they continue to grow. Traditional rating \\nplayers have entered the market, with some recent important operations such as Moody’s acquisition of a \\nmajority stake in Vigeo Eiris as well as S&P Global’s purchase of the ESG business of RobecoSAM. The most \\nused and trusted ESG ratings results to be  MSCI  and Sustainalytics  for their broad  coverage. MSCI is \\nparticularly appreciated for its quality research, transparency and data quality,  while  Sustainalytics  has been \\nmentioned for its broad coverage, recent SA BS alignment and  transparency.  CDP and ISS are also widely used, \\nmainly for their quality and usefulness.  ESG research industry is made up of a growing set of companies that \\ncollect and analyse data related to a diverse array of ESG issues. The ESG resea rch ecosystem is characterized \\nby: \\n• Standards setters help structure and prioritize ESG reporting and disclosures.  \\n• Data aggregators: provide extensive sets of structured data culled from publicly available sources.  \\n• Specialized data: some firms focus on specialized data related to particular ESG issues.  \\n• Rating agencies: ratings offer a composite environmental, social and governance perspective, enabling \\ninvestors to compare and rank companies relative to their industry peers.  \\n \\nThe ESG research ecosystem  \\n(Source: https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/whitepaper/an- evolution -in-esg-indexing.pdf ) \\nEven if this market expansion is contributing to let the ESG ratings and rankings entering the  mainstream \\nfinance, some concerns on data quality and integration with traditional financial reporting  and research are \\nstill concerning main  players : \\n• There is little  consensus  abou t which  ESG issues  and information are  material.   \\n• There is still a lack of reporting  standards  that are universally  accepted.   \\n• Company  level  ESG ratings  from  different  rating  agencies  show  low correlations  due \\nto differences  in their  methodologies  \\n42 \\n \\nSDG Impact  Standards   \\nThe aim of  the SDG Impact Standards  (hereafter “the Standards”)  is to introduce a clear framework  for \\nintegrating impacts on SDGs into business and investment decision making. Thus,  the Standards provide a set \\nof practices for (1)  private equity funds , (2) bonds  and (3)  enterprises , that help  them align their activities with \\nthe SDGs and facilitate mobilising resources towards the SDGs.  The Standards  are not only standards for \\nreporting, but  they  provide a  common language  and best -practice guidance  for integrating impact \\nmanagement into internal management and decision -making  (aligning with the Impact Management Project’s \\n(IMP) Five Dimensions of Impact and ABC Impact Classifications, which provide a shared language of impact \\nand a consisten t approach).    \\n The foundational elements of the Standards are :   \\n• contributing positively to  sustainable development and  achieving the SDGs;   \\n• a minimum level to be achieved  by demonstrating  respect human rights and other responsible \\nbusiness practices  (as set out in the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, and the \\nTen Principles of the UN Global Compact);   \\n• effective impact management and decision -making.   \\nThe Standards fit with existing principles, frameworks and tools, since t hey are grounded in high level principles \\nand provide context for integrating other tools and frameworks into decision -making.   \\nThe Standards comprise four Standards, one for each of the four themes – strategy, management approach, \\ntransparency and governa nce. \\n \\nLevels of SDG Impact Standards  \\n(Source: https://sdgimpact.undp.org/private -equity.html ) \\nStandard 1 (Strategy): \\u202fEmbedding foundational elements into purpose and strategy   \\nStandard 2 (Management Approach):  Integrating foundational elements into operations and management \\napproach   \\nStandard 3 (Transparency): \\u202fDisclosing how foundational elements are integrated into purpose, strategy, \\nmanagement approach and governance, and reporting on pe rformance   \\n43 \\n \\nStandard 4 (Governance): \\u202fReinforcing commitment to foundational elements through governance practices   \\nTo better explain how the Standards work we focus here on the example of how they can be applied to Private \\nEquity Funds . \\n In this case, the Standards aim at closing the gap  for achieving the SDGs by 2030, encouraging  Funds to move \\ntheir activities towards economic, social and environmental challenges; generating  trusted, credible and \\nactionable impact information that inform s investment decisions; promoting  impact integrity and avoiding \\nimpact washing; and embedding  review and feedback loops to support continuous improvement and learning. \\nThe Standards can be applied by Private Equity funds, as well as by private debt and ven ture capital funds, \\nregardless of size, geography and sector of the funds.  \\nStandard 1 (Strategy):  The Fund embeds contributing positively to sustainable development and achieving the \\nSDGs in its purpose and strategy.  \\nThe Fund:  \\n• develops an  impact thesis  (or theses), links its purpose and strategy to this thesis and determines how \\nit intends to contribute positively to the SDGs, including the target SDG areas, the type of impact it \\nintends to achieve and sets in context of its impact risk appetite and tol erance.  \\n• sets realistic  portfolio -level impact goals  aligned with its purpose, impact thesis and investment \\nstrategy, and considers the potential for unintended negative or perverse outcomes.  \\n• periodically revises and refines the impact thesis,  investment st rategy and portfolio level impact goals \\nto ensure they are aligned with the purpose over the Fund lifecycle and changes in the sustainable development context.  \\nStandard 2 (Management Approach):  The Fund integrates impact management and contributing positively to \\nsustainable development and achieving the SDGs into its operations and management approach.  \\nThe Fund:  \\n• embeds in its policies and practices the compliance with human rights, other responsible practices and \\nlocal and international laws and regulations (UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and Ten Principles of the UN Global), striving to comply with the highest possible level of industry best \\npractice.  \\n• implements effective mechanisms  and processes:  \\no to proactively monitor its performance and conformance  with its responsible business and \\nimpact management policies and practices, and embeds a culture of continuous improvement;  \\no to identify Stakeholders materially affected  (or likely to be affected) by its and its Investees’ \\nactivities;  \\no to collect, manage and use its impact data ;  \\no to ensure its impact management practices  remain  fit for purpose.  \\n• establishes pre -screening criteria for potential investments  to assess alignment with its purpose and \\nstrategy, including its impact thesis and impact goals.  \\n• conducts  ex ante impact assessments  of potential investments to assess relevant and material impacts \\n(positive, negative, intended, and unintended impacts – see IMP) and the Investee’s mitigation 44 \\n \\nstrategy for all negative material impacts it exposes, and to determine the Fund’s expected \\ncontributions to the impact performance of each investment.  \\n• engages with potential Investees  during the due diligence and investment structuring phase, to agree \\non how to embed impact considerations within the investment terms , and so optimize future impact \\nperformance.  \\n• systematically  monitors and manages its ongoing impact performance  overall and for each investment \\nand acts to optimize impact (including managing unexpected outcomes).  \\n• proactively manages its exits from investments to optimize impact.  \\nStandard  3 (Transparency):  The Fund discloses how it integrates contributing positively to sustainable \\ndevelopment and achieving the SDGs into its strategy, management approach, governance and decision making, \\nand reports (at least annually) on its performance.  \\nThe Fund:  \\n• discloses relevant information  about the Fund in its legal and offering documentation to enable \\npotential Investees, limited partners and Stakeholders to make informed decisions.  \\n• reports publicly at least annually on the Fund’s impact performance at the portfolio level  against the \\nFund’s impact thesis and portfolio level impact goals; and at the investment level  (where feasible), \\nperformance against investment level impact targets.  \\nStandard 4 (Governance):  The Fund’s commitment to contributing posi tively to sustainable development and \\nachieving the SDGs is reinforced through governance practices of the Fund and the Fund Manager.  \\nThe Fund:  \\n• has governing bodies  that have competencies concerning sustainable development issues and impact \\nmanagement.   \\n• has active oversight  from its governing bodies on:  \\no its policies on respect for human rights and other responsible business and impact \\nmanagement policies;  \\no process of Stakeholder identification and involvement in decision making;  \\no its purpose and approach to creating sustainable long -term value, portfolio level impact goals \\nand investment strategy;  \\no the compatibility of its impact thesis performance and conformance with its impact \\nmanagement policies and practices;  \\no progress against its portfolio level impa ct goals;  \\no sustainable development related disclosures and external reporting.  \\n  45 \\n \\nImpact Management Project  \\nThe Impact Management Project (IMP) is a global network of standard -setting organizations that aim to \\naccelerate widespread adoption of impact measu rement and management. IMP provides a forum for building \\nglobal consensus on how to measure, manage and report impacts on sustainability, and convenes a community \\nof over 2000 practitioner to share best practice, understand technical issue and identify are as where is \\nrequired to build further consensus in impact measurement and management. IMP provides a common logic \\nto help enterprises and investors to better understand and manage their effects on people and the planet, in \\norder to reduce the negative and increase the positive.  \\nImpact Management project defines five dimensions (What, Who, How Much, Contribution, Risk)  through \\nwhich evaluate each effect (intended or unintended, positive or negative) on people or planet. These \\ndimensions help the enterprise t o identify the outcome it is contributing to, which stakeholders are \\nexperiencing the outcome and its importance for them, the dimension of the outcome (e.g. number of \\nstakeholders, degree of change), its attribution, the likelihood that actual impact will  be different than \\nexpected and other information.  \\nIn order to operationalize these dimensions, IMP introduces 15 impact data categories (see figure below). The objective of the impact categories is not to replace existing framework and standards but to in tegrate with \\nthem. Indeed, according to the IMP, data categories should be seen as building blocks that can be used as a guideline to create the enterprise impact management framework or as a checklist to ensure that the \\nenterprise is not missing any impor tant piece for managing impact.  \\nAccording to their own motivation (for example, comply with regulatory norm or generate positive impact), \\nthe investors’ and enterprises’ intentions can range from a broad commitment to mitigate risk or to leave e \\npositive m ark on the world, to more detailed objectives related to a specific group of people, place or outcome, \\nor to a specific social or environmental challenge.  \\nThese different intentions lead to the three types of impact defined by the IMP:  \\n• A: Act to avoid harm . This is the minimum level, the investors or the enterprises comply with regulatory \\nrequirements, or adopt a responsible behaviour  \\n• B: Benefit to stakeholders . Enterprises and investors act with specific objective of generating positive \\neffect on the world  to sustain their long -term financial performance, or they can aim to create a world \\nwhere the business try to have a positive effect on society.  \\n• C. Contribute to the solutions . Enterprises and investors can use their capabilities to solve or focus the \\nattention to pressing social or environmental problems in specific social or geographical area.  \\nAdopting these three impact categories, enterprises can benchmark their performances across the five \\ndimensions against other enterprises.  46 \\n \\n \\n IMP Five Impact Dimensions and the 15 Impact Data Categories \\n(Source: https://impactmanagementproject.com/impact -management/impact -management -norms /#anchor3 ) \\n \\nIMP identifies different strategies that an investor can use to contribute to impact. These strategies are not \\nmutually exclusive, but they are often used in combination. The investors ’ contributions are the following:  \\n1. Signal that measurable im pact matters : this is a sort of value alignment of the investors, which express \\ntheir values. However, alone it is not very useful to progress on societal issues.  \\n2. Engage actively : engagement can vary from dialogue with companies, to creation of industry \\nstandards, to investors that use their own team or consultants to provide impact management support \\nto the investee. This strategy involves a significant proactive effort to improve impact.  \\n3. Grow new or undersupplied capital markets : investments “grow new o r undersupplied capital markets” \\nif they enable the enterprise to deliver impact that would likely not otherwise occur, or, if they \\npressure the enterprise to increase its impact generation and/or rewards it for doing so (for example, \\nchanging the price of  enterprise’s securities).  \\n4. Provide flexible capital : the investors recognize that certain types of enterprises require lower risk \\nadjusted financial return to generate specific impacts.  \\nBringing together the impact of the underlying enterprises/assets in t he portfolio (the “ABC” impact) and the \\nabove- mentioned contribution, the IMP defines the Investor’s Impact Matrix, which is compose by 12 boxes – \\nthe “Impact classes” -  that classifies the impact of a portfolio. The impact classes can be useful to understand \\n47 \\n \\nif an investment opportunity is aligned with the investor’s impact intentions. The matrix is therefore a tool \\nthat help investors to describe and communicate the impact characteristic of an investment opportunity.  \\nThe figure below shows an example of i nvestor’s impact matrix, populated with examples of investment \\narchetypes.  \\n \\nExample of the Impact Classes Matrix  \\n(Source: https://impactmanagementproject.com/impact -management/how -investors- manage -impact)  \\nImpact Weighted Accounts  \\nDeveloped by The Impact -Weighted Account Initiative (IWAI), a research -led joint effort by the Global Steering \\nGroup (GSG) and the IMP, incubated at Harvard Business School, the mission of the Impact -Weighted Accounts \\nProject is to lead the creation of financial accounts that refl ect a company’s financial, social and environmental \\nperformance.   \\nThis initiative is based on four main principles:  \\n1. Impact can be measured and compared  \\n2. Impact should be measured within an accounting framework with the aim of harnessing the economy \\nto improve society and planet  \\n3. Transformational change require that impact measurement be scalable  \\n4. To be scalable it needs to be actionable and cost effective is a tool aimed to drive the creation of \\nfinancial accounts that reflect a company’s financial, socia l, and environmental performance. It is \\ndeveloped  by Harvard Business School  (2019).  \\n48 \\n \\nThus, the purpose is to create and define an intuitive measurement  unit (translates impact into comparable \\nunits that business managers and investor understand),  comparabl e and aggregated  (meaningful aggregation \\nand comparison), and  an existing assessment  tools  (allows for the use of existing financial and business \\nanalysis tools to assess performance).   \\nThe ambition of the IWAI is to drive companies towards an integrated v ision of performance that enables \\ninvestors and managers to make informed decisions based not only on monetized private gains or losses, but \\nalso on the broader impact (i.e. social and environmental) that a company generates.  \\nWithin this vision, Impact- weighted accounts are line items on a financial statement, as an income statement \\nor a balance sheet, that are added to integrate the health and financial performance report, reflecting a \\ncompany’s positive and negative impacts on employees, customers, enviro nment and the wider society  \\nBased on the Theory of Change, the IWAI has developed its research activities and the development of standardized measurement framework according to three main research pillars:  \\n1. Employment impact of organizations on their employees   \\n2. Environment: impact from organization’s operations   \\n3. Product: impact on society and environment from product use   \\nThe objective of IWAI is not to create a new, standalone standard for companies to report against, rather to \\nsupport efforts to produce a singular standard for Environmental, Social and Governance reporting, ensuring \\nthat those initiatives include metrics, which can be used to effectively measure impact.  \\nFor this reason, the frameworks developed during the years are integrated with  the existing standards and \\nframeworks, seeking to leverage metrics that are already been captured.  \\nEven if not of all the metrics included in common ESG standards are suitable for translation into impact \\nmeasures, by highlighting the suitable ones, IWAI a im to educated standard setters, investors and corporates, \\non the type of information required for measuring organizational impact in monetary terms.  \\nIWAI produces monetized impact values to assess an organization’s environment, employee, and product \\nimpac ts. These impacts are reproducible as the IWAI impact measurement methodologies are all publicly \\navailable. By creating transparent and comparable measures of impact, IWAI empowers organizations to \\nintegrate these measures into their own analyses, enhancin g trade -off assessments and materiality \\nassessments.  \\nIWAI similarly seeks to quantify the externalities and has taken an approach which is scalable and can be applied using data available in the public domain today. Where some monetization efforts focus on  uncaptured \\ncosts of highly specific products, IWAI measures the impacts of organization’s operational decisions.  \\n  49 \\n \\nSocial Return on investment  \\nSocial Return on Investment (SROI) is an outcomes -based measurement tool that helps organizations to \\nunderstand and quantify the social, environmental and economic value they are creating. The SROI is used to \\ncapture and monetize the social value created by the activities of the organization. An SROI analysis produces \\na narrative of how an organization creates and d estroys value in the course of making change in the world, \\nand a ratio that states how much social value (in £) is created for every £1 of investment (NEF, 2007).  \\nCarrying out an SROI analysis involves six stages:  \\n1. Establishing scope and identifying key sta keholders. It is important to have clear boundaries about \\nwhat your SROI analysis will cover, who will be involved in the process and how.  \\n2. Mapping outcomes. Through engaging with your stakeholders you will develop an impact map, or theory of change, which shows the relationship between inputs, outputs and outcomes.  \\n3. Evidencing outcomes and giving them a value. This stage involves finding data to show whether \\noutcomes have happened and then valuing them.  \\n4. Establishing impact. Having collected evidence on outco mes and monetised them, those aspects of \\nchange that would have happened anyway or are a result of other factors are eliminated from consideration.  \\n5. Calculating the SROI. This stage involves adding up all the benefits, subtracting any negatives and comparin g the result to the investment. This is also where the sensitivity of the results can be tested.  \\n6. Reporting, using and embedding. Easily forgotten, this vital last step involves sharing findings with stakeholders and responding to them, embedding good outcomes processes and verification of the \\nreport.  \\nSROI is based on seven principles : \\n1. Involve stakeholders:  actors who are affected by the activities carried out, they may define the social \\nvalue produced (positive or not) and identify appropriate indicat ors for measuring the social impact.  \\n2. Understand what changes: measuring outcomes to make explicit changes.  \\n3. Value the things that matter: monetize using financial proxy for measuring outcomes.  \\n4. Only include what is material: relevant and pertinent.  \\n5. Do not o ver-claim: define what would have happened anyway and what has been realized thanks to \\nthe contribution and participation of other subjects.  \\n6. Be transparent: to declare and support how stakeholders, outcomes, indicators and benchmarks were \\nidentified; the i nformation -gathering mode.  \\n7. Verify the result: to involve an independent third party.  \\nSROI offers the following potential benefits:  \\n• It can help organisations understand what social value an activity creates in a robust and rigorous way \\nand so manage its activities and relationships to maximise that value.  \\n• The process opens up a dialogue with stakeholders, helping to assess the degree to which activities \\nare meeting their needs and expectations.  \\n• SROI puts social impact into the language of ‘return on inves tment’, which is widely understood by \\ninvestors, commissioners and lenders. There is increasing interest in SROI as a way to demonstrate or measure the social value of investment, beyond the standard financial measurement.  \\n• Where it is not being used alread y, SROI may be helpful in showing potential customers (for example, \\npublic bodies or other large purchasers) that they can develop new ways to define what they want out \\nof contracts, by taking account of social and environmental impacts.  \\n• SROI can also be u sed in strategic management. The monetised indicators can help management \\nanalyse what might happen if they change their strategy, as well as allow them to evaluate the 50 \\n \\nsuitability of that strategy to generating social returns, or whether there may be better means of using \\ntheir resources.  \\n• Assurance and verification is available through a number of bodies, including The SROI Network.  \\n• While the potential limitations are:  \\n• If there are not already good outcomes data collection systems in place, it can be time -consuming to \\nconduct an evaluative SROI analysis first time around.  \\n• There is a danger of focusing narrowly on the ratio. The ratio is only meaningful within the wider \\nnarrative about the organisations. Just as an astute investor would not make a financial  decision based \\non just one number, the same practice applies to this social measurement tool. For this reason, \\ncomparisons between organisations just based on the ratio are not recommended.  \\n• SROI is an outcome, rather than a process evaluation. The dialogu e with stakeholders yields some \\ninsight into what works and what doesn’t and why, but there may be instances where a more specific process evaluation would be useful.  \\n• SROI requires a diverse skill set –  from stakeholder engagement to working with Excel spr eadsheets. \\nThis can be hard to find in one person.  \\n• SROI was developed initially for use in the third sector. It has now been used by a range of public and \\nthird sector organisations of varying sizes.  \\n  51 \\n \\nGlossary  \\nAPPROACH (in the chapter we also used the terms  FRAMEWORK, METHOD, MODEL as synonymous)  \\n• Approaches to Impact Measurement are the range of methods that exist ( Adapted from So, I., & \\nStaskevicius, A.
